# Runtime

Each emitted project links against a per-target runtime that ships
in two layers: **target primitives** (hand-written) and the
**framework runtime** (transpiled from Ruby).

**Source:** `runtime/<target>/` for primitives; `runtime/ruby/` for
the framework runtime (consumed by all non-Ruby targets via the same
roundhouse pipeline that compiles user apps).

## The two-layer split

```
runtime/ruby/                    ← single source of framework Ruby
  active_record/                    transpiled into the emit pipeline
  action_controller/                  ↓
  action_view/                      framework-runtime files appear in
  action_dispatch/                  the emitted project (e.g. TS emit
  inflector.rb                      writes src/active_record_base.ts,
  json_builder.rb                   src/action_controller_base.ts, …)
  ...

runtime/<target>/                ← per-target primitives, hand-written
  db.<ext>                          DB connections, HTTP server,
  server.<ext>                      WebSocket plumbing, test harness —
  cable.<ext>                       genuinely target-idiomatic glue
  test_support.<ext>                that no IR-level lowering captures
  ...
```

### Why two layers?

- **Framework runtime is target-uniform Rails surface.** Models'
  `validates`, controller action helpers, view helpers like
  `link_to` / `form_with` / `pluralize` — these have one canonical
  Ruby implementation. Authoring them N times in N target
  languages is exactly the duplication the lowering layer was
  built to eliminate; transpiling them once subsumes it.
- **Target primitives are unavoidably idiomatic.** Wiring axum
  middleware vs. Node's `http` module vs. Plug's pipeline DSL vs.
  Crystal's `HTTP::Server` looks different in a way no IR
  captures. Hand-writing these stays cheap because each target's
  primitive layer is small (a few hundred lines).

The forcing function: **any target that compiles user Rails apps
must also compile `runtime/ruby/`**. If your emitter can transpile
ApplicationRecord + FormBuilder + Inflector, it can transpile a
real Rails app. Phase 1 of the unified-IR plan front-loaded this
risk by transpiling `runtime/ruby/` to TypeScript before any user-
app emission depended on the result.

## Target primitives — what's in each `runtime/<target>/`

Conventional file roles (file names vary by target):

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Model base / shims | `ActiveRecordAdapter` trait / adapter interface, validation error type |
| DB connection | Lifecycle (open, with_conn borrow, test-mode database — in-memory on the typed targets, a per-test file on the ruby family since the shared-cache lock, see `runtime/spinel/test/test_helper.rb`) |
| HTTP server | Production HTTP entry — listens on a port, dispatches through Router |
| Action Cable | WebSocket endpoint |
| View helpers | Delegates into transpiled framework Ruby (where present) or implements helpers directly (legacy) |
| Test support | TestClient + TestResponse + Rails-shaped assertions |

The exact file set varies per target and rots fast in prose; the
authoritative inventories are the `include_str!` tables in each
target's emitter (`src/emit/typescript.rs`, `src/emit/go.rs`,
`src/emit/elixir.rs`, …) and, for the Ruby family, the runtime walk
in `src/project.rs`. Shape notes worth knowing:

- `runtime/go/` and `runtime/elixir/` keep their primitives under a
  `v2/` sublayout (a strangler-era name the emitted tree still uses)
  — the Go/Elixir emitters copy from there.
- `runtime/typescript/` carries db/server variants selected by the
  `DeploymentProfile` (sync sqlite, libsql, worker), the worker
  bridge (`juntos*.ts`), and async/sync minitest adapters.
  Framework-runtime files (`active_record_base.ts`,
  `action_controller_base.ts`, …) are emitter-generated from
  `runtime/ruby/` and appear under `src/` in emitted projects, not in
  this directory.
- `runtime/spinel/` is by far the largest: per-target Ruby primitives
  (DB adapters per interpreter, CGI/ERB shims, message digests, …)
  plus `tep/` (an embedded HTTP/WebSocket server), `facades/`
  (hand-written typed stand-ins, each with an RBS sidecar), a
  `scaffold/` tree overlaid into
  every emitted Ruby/Spinel project, and a `test/` tree of
  target-specific test files.

## Framework runtime — `runtime/ruby/`

Ruby authoritative source for the Rails surface every emitted app
calls into:

```
runtime/ruby/
  active_record/        ApplicationRecord, validations, querying
  action_controller/    Base controller, Parameters
  action_view/          link_to, form_with, FormBuilder, pluralize, ...
  action_dispatch/      Routing helpers
  action_text.rb        Content (the has_rich_text coder), Attachment
  inflector.rb          camelize / pluralize / dasherize
  ...                   plus mailer/job/storage/params modules and the
                        runtime's own test suite — see the directory
```

`runtime/ruby/test/` is the framework runtime's own test suite, run
per target by the `framework-tests-<target>` CI jobs.

`action_text.rb` holds only Action Text's VALUE layer.
`ActionText::RichText` is absent because it has a table: it is
synthesized as an ordinary model by `lower::rich_text` and reaches
every target through the model machinery. That split — table-backed
things are models, values are framework Ruby — is the general rule,
not an Action Text special case.

Nearly every `.rb` ships with a `.rbs` sidecar declaring the public typed
surface (see `analyze.md` on RBS-paired ingestion). The `.rbs` is
what makes the framework runtime typeable without annotating every
internal expression — only the public boundary commits to a type.

## How files reach the emitted project

Target primitives ship via Rust's `include_str!` at emitter compile
time:

```rust
const RUNTIME_SOURCE: &str = include_str!("../../runtime/rust/runtime.rs");
const DB_SOURCE: &str = include_str!("../../runtime/rust/db.rs");
// ...etc.
```

These strings are written verbatim into the generated project as
`src/runtime.rs`, `src/db.rs`, etc.

Framework runtime files ship via the same emit pipeline that compiles
user apps — `runtime/ruby/active_record/` is ingested with its RBS
sidecar, lowered, and emitted into the generated project as
`src/active_record_base.ts` (etc.) by the same code path that
compiles user controllers and models. The driver is
`src/runtime_loader.rs`: a per-target `TargetEmit` hook set plus
per-target entry points (`typescript_units`, `crystal_units`,
`rust_units`, `go_units`, `elixir_units`, `kotlin_units`,
`swift_units`, `csharp_units`, `python_units`, …) — most targets have
one today. The parse layer underneath is `src/runtime_src.rs`. There
is no separate `bin/build-runtime` binary; emission runs inline as
part of `cargo run --bin roundhouse -- --target <t>` (or `--site` for
the full archive matrix).

The Ruby family is the asymmetry: Spinel / Ruby / JRuby receive the
framework Ruby VERBATIM — the Ruby-family assembly in
`src/project.rs` walks `runtime/ruby/` into the emitted tree as text,
and a text-level tree-shake (`emit::ruby::shake`, run from
`src/project.rs::target_files`) trims what the app doesn't reference
— while every other target gets the IR transpile described above.

## Why hand-write the primitives?

1. **Framework integration is language-idiomatic.** axum middleware,
   Node's event loop, Plug's pipeline, Crystal's `HTTP::Handler` chain
   each look different in a way no higher-level IR captures.
2. **Editability.** When a primitive needs to grow (new middleware,
   new helper hook), editing a normal `.rs` / `.ts` file with IDE
   tooling is faster than editing a string inside a `format!`-driven
   emitter.

The tradeoff: emitters and primitives stay in lockstep. If
`view_helpers.rs` adds a function, the corresponding emitter (or, for
helpers, the `runtime/ruby/action_view/` source) has to learn to call
it. Snapshot tests + toolchain tests catch drift.

## Emitter ↔ runtime contract

For each target:

- **Emitter assumes** specific function names, signatures, and
  imports from the runtime (both layers).
- **Runtime guarantees** those functions exist and behave.
- **Snapshot tests** catch drift in emitter output.
- **Toolchain tests** catch drift in the runtime — if it no longer
  compiles, or if `cargo test` / `tsc --strict` / `crystal build`
  fails, the gate blocks the merge.

When adding a new helper: land the runtime change and the emitter
change in the same commit. Runtime that ships without emitter uptake
is dead code; emitter output that references a non-existent runtime
function is a compile failure in the generated project.

## Key files

| Directory | Role |
|-----------|------|
| `runtime/ruby/` | Framework runtime — Ruby source + RBS sidecars |
| `runtime/rust/` | Rust primitives |
| `runtime/typescript/` | TS primitives (framework runtime is emitter-generated from `runtime/ruby/`) |
| `runtime/crystal/` | Crystal primitives |
| `runtime/{go,python,elixir,kotlin,swift,csharp,spinel}/` | Sibling targets (go/elixir under a `v2/` sublayout) |
| `src/emit/<target>.rs` | Emitter side that reads + embeds the runtime |
| `src/runtime_loader.rs` | Framework-transpile driver — `TargetEmit` hooks + per-target `*_units` entry points |
| `src/runtime_src.rs` | Parse layer: runtime Ruby + RBS → `MethodDef`s (no emission) |

## Deliberate divergences from Rails

Places where the runtime knowingly answers differently from Rails. Each
is a decision, not a gap — a gap belongs in the diagnostics ledger
instead. **A divergence must be recorded here when it is chosen**: an
undocumented one reads as intent to the next session precisely because
it is applied consistently, and the emit gives no signal that anyone
weighed it.

### Spinel `Date` is a bounded runtime value

The Spinel target defines a small `Date` class in
`runtime/spinel/date.rb` for Rails date columns. It stores a Gregorian
year, month, and day; database storage and JSON use `YYYY-MM-DD`, with
no clock or zone. Its ISO parser accepts only that exact format and
validates the calendar date.

This is not Ruby's stdlib `date` package. `DateTime`, Julian/Italian
calendar modes, natural-language and non-ISO parsing, schema date
defaults, ActiveSupport date extensions, date picker helpers, and
`require "date"` are not included. `strftime` implements the date
directives used by the admitted runtime contract and raises on other
directives. The compiler continues diagnosing those unsupported paths.
JRuby and other targets keep their existing Date boundary until they
have their own runtime.

The Date package — `runtime/spinel/date.rb`, date parse/format
(`active_support_date_parsing.rb`), the date JSON rewrite
(`active_record_date_serialization.rb`), matching RBS, and boot
requires — is injected only when `app_uses_date` is true (schema date
columns or date values in emitted roots). Default `as_json` stays
always-on via `active_record_serialization.rb`. Loading
`Date#strftime` into every Spinel app currently breaks poly
`Time | Date` receivers for `Time#strftime` (matz/spinel#7334);
Campfire has no date columns and must not pay that cost. Once upstream
fixes the poly method table, unconditional load is safe again.

Date-column JSON is rewritten in the omit-gated Spinel reopen (after
the shared time-aware `_as_json_only`), not in `runtime/ruby/
active_record/connection.rb` — the CRuby overlay has its own
reflection-aware Date path, and a shared date branch would tax Bar B /
AR RBS probes for every app. Raw `where(due_on: some_date)` predicates
format through `SqliteAdapter.escape_value` →
`ActiveSupport.format_db_date` so the SQL compares against
`YYYY-MM-DD` text, not a timestamp.

### `id` is `0` before save, not `nil` (`""` for a string key)

Each model's own `initialize` seeds `self.id = attrs[:id] || 0` — `||
""` when the key column is a string or uuid. Rails answers
`Article.new.id == nil` (measured against Rails 8.1).

**Why.** A nullable primary key means `Option<i64>` in Rust and `Int?`
in Kotlin/Swift/C#, with an unwrap at every foreign-key comparison, path
helper and join. The sentinel keeps ids plain machine integers across
every target. Foreign keys follow the same convention — the
synthesized `belongs_to` readers test `@creator_id == 0` (`== ""` for
a uuid foreign key).

**Where the slot lives.** On the model, never on `ActiveRecord::Base`.
The base's `id`/`id=` are a raise-bodied contract; under Spinel a
base-class ivar is the union of every subclass's writes, so a base
`@id` let one String-keyed model widen every model's key to poly and
drop each one's `--rbs` pin (roundhouse#90). On the transpile path
the property-typed targets see the contract as the `attr_accessor`
plus `@id = 0` it stands in for (`runtime_src::
reclassify_abstract_attributes`), so their base is unchanged.

**What depends on it.** `ty_of_column_slot` excludes the primary key
from nullability, so the RBS declares `id: Integer` (non-null) while a
genuinely nullable column declares `String?`. The two must agree: a
write of `nil` into `@id` contradicts both the sentinel and the
signature, and spinel widens the slot on the *possibility* — one
unreachable nil arm in `[]=` boxed `@id` on every model in the corpus.

**Where it is visible.** Only where app code reads `id` on an unsaved
record. The framework never does: `form_with` picks its action from
`persisted?`, and so does `dom_id`. `record.id.nil?` is `false` here
where Rails says `true`.

### An attribute writer does not TYPE-CAST to the column's type

Rails casts on assignment: `Message.create!(client_message_id: 999)`
into a `t.string` column stores the String `"999"`, and
`record.client_message_id` reads back `"999"` before and after the
INSERT. The writer this runtime generates is a bare `@col = value`, so
the attribute holds the Integer `999` until the row is written, and the
adapter's `escape_string` is what finally renders it.

**Why.** A cast per write means every generated writer carries the
column's coercion, in every target — and the coercions do not agree
across them (`999.to_s` is not `String(999)` is not `"" + 999`). The
value reaches the database through one escaper per column type, which
is already the single place that knows the column's type, so a write
that goes straight to storage arrives correct without the writer
knowing anything.

**What it costs.** Anything that reads the attribute BETWEEN the
assignment and the INSERT sees the uncast value — which in practice
means a `before_save`/`before_create` callback, and app code that reads
back what it just assigned. campfire's suite writes
`create! client_message_id: 999` into a string column
(`test/controllers/users/sidebars_controller_test.rb:17`), and its
`before_create` guard reads that attribute.

**What depends on it.** Any synthesized guard over a string column must
branch on the VALUE, not on the column type — which is why
`lower::blank::synthesized_string_blank` grounds to
`ActiveSupport.blank?` rather than to the String form
`(r || "").strip.empty?`. The String form raises `undefined method
'strip' for an instance of Integer` on exactly the case above. **A
schema type describes the column, not what the attribute holds before
the INSERT**, and a lowering that reads `attributes.fields` is reading
the former.

The fix, when it is worth making, belongs in the writer — one cast per
string column, at the one site that already knows the type — and it
changes what every reader sees, so it is a change to make deliberately
rather than as a side effect.

### An absent UNSIGNED cookie reads as `""`, not `nil`

`cookies[:missing]` answers `""`; Rails answers `nil`.

**The SIGNED read is nullable and no longer diverges** —
`cookies.signed[:missing]` answers `nil`, and so does anything that does
not verify (a tampered payload, a bad signature, a value signed for a
different cookie name). That is the read where the difference was
visible to an app rather than absorbed by a `.to_s`: `if token =
cookies.signed[:session_token]` is campfire's `SessionLookup`, and an
empty String is TRUTHY in Ruby, so a signed-out request took the
signed-in branch and queried for `token: ""` — right by accident, one
query Rails never makes, and simply wrong for a call site that only
checked presence. Everything below is about the unsigned jar.

**Why.** The store is `Hash[String, String]`, and a nullable String puts
every read on spinel's nullable path: `cookies[k].to_s.split(",")`
yields a null array there, which is how lobsters'
`remove_unknown_cookies` first met this. Every call site in the corpus
coerces with `.to_s`, under which `""` and `nil` are identical.

**What depends on it.** `raw` returns `""` as its final fallback, and
`delete` records a cleared write as `""` rather than a tombstone, so
`@out` stays a plain String→String map — the harness and both
dispatchers read that empty as "expire this cookie". `SignedCookieJar#[]`
sits ON TOP of `raw` and maps its `""` back to nil, so the nullable read
costs the store nothing.

**Where it is still visible.** `cookies[:missing]` is truthy where Rails
is falsy. No corpus call site reads the unsigned jar for presence — every
one coerces with `.to_s` — which is why the signed read was closed and
this one was not.

### Redirect host protection is not modeled

`redirect_to` preserves its existing caller-validated destination behavior
and accepts `allow_other_host: true`. The shared base has no request host
context; `allow_other_host: false` raises `NotImplementedError` before
setting a response, rather than silently claiming host validation.
Callers permitting external redirects must pin or validate the destination;
Campfire's Google login pins its production DQOR issuer URL.

### An enum attribute reader yields the STORED value

`user.status` answers `0` where Rails answers `"active"`. The generated
predicates and scopes carry the stored value too, which is what makes
them correct with no enum type at runtime. Fixing the reader means
mapping at every read; do it only if an app is found that reads the raw
attribute.

### An attachment sgid resolves through a generated locator, not reflection

`ActionText::Content#attachables` — the untyped list of every record a
fragment's `<action-text-attachment sgid="…">` nodes point at — still
answers `[]`. Two typed routes exist instead. Where the caller names
its class, `attachable_ids("User")` verifies each node's sgid and
answers the ids minted for that model, and `lower::attachables_grep`
rewrites the shape app code actually writes into a query over them:

```text
body.attachables.grep(User)  →  User.where(id: body.attachable_ids("User")).to_a
```

Where it does not — `ActionText::Attachment.from_node(node).attachable`,
the shape campfire's tests build — the sgid's verified model NAME is
turned into a finder by `ActionText::Attachable.locate(model_name, id)`,
which `project::apply_attachable_locate` GENERATES into the emitted
tree's `global_id_locator.rb` (`runtime/spinel/global_id_locator.rb`,
the ruby family's) as one `when "<Model>" then
<Model>.find_by(id: id)` per model that mixes `ActionText::Attachable`
in. Nothing answering — no sgid, a signature that does not verify, a
model no arm names, a row since deleted — is an
`ActionText::Attachables::MissingAttachable`, as Rails' rescue of
`RecordNotFound` makes it.

**Why generated.** Dereferencing an arbitrary sgid needs a
name-to-class map, and building one at run time means reflection
(`constantize` from a wire string) or per-model registration at load.
The includer set is closed at ingest, so the switch IS the registry:
no `const_get`, nothing a crafted name can steer, and an app with no
attachable model keeps a body that answers nil. A bare `attachables`
has no such caller and keeps the `[]`.

**The wire format is Rails'.** `ActionText::SignedGlobalId` mints
the bytes `SignedGlobalID` mints: `gid://<app>/<Model>/<id>?expires_in`
as the `data` of a `_rails` envelope, url-safe base64 WITH padding,
HMAC-SHA1 under the key derived from the `signed_global_ids` salt —
each of those a measurement against campfire under Rails 8.2, not a
reading of the gem, and `runtime/ruby/test/action_text_test.rb` pins
the literal that process produced so the two ends stay
interoperable by test (`MessageVerifier.gid_envelope` holds the
derivation). This is the third envelope the verifier writes, beside
the cookie's and the signed id's, and the reason it matters is a
database Rails wrote: every @mention in `action_text_rich_texts.body`
is one of these sgids, and under the `<Model>/<id>` shape this
runtime used to sign they all read as missing. (The `?expires_in` is
globalid serializing `attachable_sgid`'s `expires_in: nil` as a bare
key; it is inside the signed bytes, so the mint writes it and the
readers strip any query.)

**The app's tolerance for a rotated secret.** campfire's
`lib/rails_ext/action_text_attachables.rb` reopens
`Attachment.from_node`, inside an `ActiveSupport.on_load` block, to
accept a `User` sgid whose signature FAILS — so rotating
`SECRET_KEY_BASE` does not orphan every @mention — by decoding the
`_rails` envelope by hand. The class finder skips blocks, so that
file was dropped without a word. `ingest::on_load_reopen` now reads
the shape (the `ActionText::Attachment` reopen, a class-side
`from_node`, the `"_rails"` key in its body) for the one fact it
holds, the `%w[ User ]` list, and `project::apply_attachable_locate`
writes it into `global_id_locator.rb` as
`Attachment.permitted_without_signature`; the hand-decode — Rails'
7.1+ `data` string and the Rails-7 Marshal shape behind it — is
transcribed once, as `SignedGlobalId.unverified_uri`, and
`Attachment#attachable` consults it only for the listed models and
only after the signed read has failed. The thirty lines of
`JSON.parse(…).dig`, `rescue`-chained base64 and a regex over Marshal
bytes are not carried: the fact is the list, as the mint's fact is
the model name. Any other declaration inside an `on_load` block is a
survey line naming the hook and the class, not a silent drop.

`RichText#to_trix_html` hands back the stored markup instead of
rendering attachment previews into it, so an editor loads the text and
shows attachment nodes bare.

**Attachment nodes ARE rendered on the serving side.** `Content#to_s`
is Rails' `render_action_text_attachments` then the layout: each
`<action-text-attachment>` gets its attachable's partial as its inner
html — the node stays, the markup goes inside — through
`Content.render_attachment`, GENERATED per app beside the layout
(`project::apply_content_layout`): one arm per attachable model whose
`to_attachable_partial_path` names a partial the tree carries, keyed on
the node's resolved model name with the finder and the view module as
literals (`when "User" … Views::Users.mention(user)`). The order is
load-bearing for what an app does next: campfire hands the result to
`auto_link`, whose safe-list pass strips the attachment tag it does not
allow and keeps the children, so a mention reaches the page as
`users/_mention` — with no render that strip left `Hey @bender` served
as `Hey `, and a lane that does not strip served a bare element a
browser draws as nothing. The scanner is quote-aware, because
campfire's own mention nodes carry the rendered mention in a `content`
attribute with a `>` inside the quotes; `scan_tags` took the first `>`
as the end of the tag and read past the `sgid` by luck.

**Link previews render the same way, by content type.** An opengraph
embed is not an sgid but a content-type
(`application/vnd.actiontext.opengraph-embed`) that campfire's
`from_node` reopen dispatches FIRST, building an `OpengraphEmbed` from
the node's attributes with `web_url` dropping any `href`/`url` that is
not a web URL on another host. The generated `render_attachment` has
that arm ahead of the sgid `case`: a class that answers
`attachable_content_type` and defines `from_node` is asked to build
itself from the node, and its partial is rendered when it does. Three
facts the framework's own render site states are read off the class
rather than guessed: the partial's LOCAL is the class's
`model_name.element` (`opengraph_embed`, where the directory rule
said `attachable` and the body read neither), its type is the class,
and the Attachment's own readers the partial uses (`caption`) are
delegations the other way — the record carries the node in an
`attachment=` slot the seam fills, and `caption` reads through it
(`lower::attachable::push_attachment_delegation`). `link_to_if`, which
that partial writes, lowers as an `if` over the two `link_to` halves so
a `truncate`d label is escaped once.

The harness's default request host is Rails' `www.example.com` now,
not `example.org`: the own-host preview test mints
`room_url(host: "www.example.com")` and expects the app to know it as
itself.

**`auto_link` sanitizes the body first, as Rails does.** The shared
`auto_link` used to skip Rails' safe-list pass on the reasoning that
the shared `sanitize` was a raising façade; it is an engine now, and
the pass runs (`sanitize: false` skips it, as in the gem). This is what
strips the `<action-text-attachment>` and `<figure>` around a rendered
partial — neither is on the default list — so a mention or a preview
reaches the page as the partial alone on every lane, which is what
the ruby lane's real gem chain already did. Measured against the gem's
default under the oracle's bundle: 30 of 31 probes in
`tests/shared_autolink.rb` byte for byte; the one difference is an
unterminated tag the HTML5 parser closes and the scanner drops.

**Plain text asks the attachable too.** Rails' `Attachment#to_plain_text`
is the attachable's `attachable_plain_text_representation(caption)`
when it defines one and `caption.to_s` otherwise, and the node is
REPLACED whole — children included, and Trix stores an unfurled link's
rendered `<figure>` inside its node. So an opengraph embed is `""`
(campfire says so), a mention is `"@name"`, a blob is `"[caption or
filename]"` and an unresolved sgid is its caption alone. That dispatch
is per app for the same reason the render is:
`Content.attachment_plain_text` is generated beside `render_attachment`
with an arm for each attachable class that defines the hook, falling
through to the framework's own attachables (blob, remote image,
caption). Until 2026-09-21 every attachment answered `caption ||
filename` and the scanner walked into its children, so a solo
unfurled link never equalled its own plain text and
`RemoveSoloUnfurledLinkText` never fired — served bodies kept the URL
text Rails strips. `Attachment#attachable` reads the content-type
class first as well (`Content.content_type_attachable`, generated), so
a test that builds an embed node by hand and asks for its attachable
gets the `OpengraphEmbed`, not a `MissingAttachable`.

**The fragment can be written, not only read.** A `Node` is its open
tag, inner html and close tag; `inner_html=` and `node["k"] = v` rewrite
the piece they touch (an attribute is spliced into the open tag as it
was spelled, so an untouched node is still the source bytes), and
`Fragment#update` yields a copy whose `css` / `at_css` bind nodes for
write-through — the two shapes campfire's mutating filters use
(`fragment.replace("div") { |n| n.tap { |x| x.inner_html = … } }`,
`fragment.update { |s| s.at_css("div")["class"] = … }`). `find_all`
stays a read. Every expectation in `runtime/ruby/test/action_text_test.rb`
for these was measured against Rails' Nokogiri-backed Fragment.

**What always worked.** The PARSE: `#attachments` returns every node
with every attribute it carried (`sgid`, `content_type`, `caption`,
`filename`, `url`).

### Action Text decodes only the entities Rails' escaper emits

`Content#to_plain_text` decodes `&amp; &lt; &gt; &quot; &#39; &apos;
&nbsp;` and passes anything else through verbatim — `&lowast;` stays
`&lowast;` where Rails (via Nokogiri) yields `∗`.

**Why.** Decoding an arbitrary reference needs a codepoint-to-character
intrinsic the framework runtime does not carry, and a full named-entity
table is ~2000 entries for a case no corpus app produces.

**Where it is visible.** Plain-text projections only — search
indexing, the `to_plain_text.presence` fallbacks. The round trip that
matters is closed: every entity `ViewHelpers.html_escape` can emit is
in the table, so escape-then-extract recovers the original text.

### A preload scope on a RELATION is the identity, and now exists

`with_attached_<attr>` / `with_rich_text_<attr>` are generated as class
methods on the model. They are now ALSO generated as `ActiveRecord::
Relation` delegates that answer `self`, so a mid-chain call
(`find_autocompletable_users.with_attached_avatar.ordered`) resolves.

**Why.** These scopes are synthesized at emit time beside the
attachment macro, not declared by the app. So the class-side method
existed and the relation-side one did not, and a chain on a relation
VALUE was a NoMethodError on a method that plainly exists.

`build_scope_registry` carries them NOW — that entry is what lets the
scope-body rewriter thread `__rel` through a bare
`with_attached_attachment`, and without it the relation was silently
replaced by a fresh one and every accumulated `where` was lost.
campfire's `/rooms/1` served another room's messages on exactly that.
The delegate still bypasses the registry's general `__scope_` path and
stays identity, because a hop to a body that returns its argument is a
dispatch for nothing.

**Where it is visible.** Nowhere in the results: the delegate is
identity for the same reason the class-side body is (below).

### A rich-text preload scope is the identity

`with_rich_text_<attr>` and `with_rich_text_<attr>_and_embeds` return
the relation unchanged where Rails adds an `includes`.

**Why.** The synthesized reader fetches per record, so there is no
preloaded association for the hint to attach to.

**Where it is visible.** Query COUNT, not query results: a page
rendering N records issues N rich-text queries where Rails issues one.
The methods exist rather than being dropped so that call sites chaining
through them keep working.

MEASURED, so the cost is a number rather than a shrug: campfire's
`/rooms/1` with 40 messages makes 172 database round trips where Rails
makes 13. 161 of the 172 are four readers at ~40 each — the rich text
here, the message's `boosts`, and the two ActiveStorage lookups
(`attached?` and `filename`, two because each call builds a fresh
`Attached`). That is why the emitted tree serves that page at 1.34x
Rails' latency while beating it on every page with no message list
(`/searches`: 0.77 ms against 4.5 ms). `scripts/bench-campfire` is what
measures it; count CACHE MISSES, not `Db.prepare` calls, or the
per-request query cache flatters the number by half.

### A `has_json` column is its keys; the whole column is the schema again

`has_json :settings, restrict: false` gives Rails a `DataAccessor`
object out of `account.settings`. Here the reader gives the SERIALIZED
JSON text; the schema's keys are reached through the flat accessors
`lower::has_json` synthesizes (`account.settings_restrict?`), and the
two-hop source spelling rewrites to them. The seam itself is
`runtime/spinel/schematized_json.rb` plus its CRuby overlay twin —
per-target like `TypedStore`, so the strict targets carry the calls as
one named unresolved seam until a native implementation lands.

**Why.** The accessor object answers through `method_missing` and would
need a live back-reference into the record for a write through it to be
visible in the record — neither survives static resolution. The schema
is a compile-time fact, so it expands instead.

**The whole column, both directions, is the schema applied again.**
`record[:settings]` answers a Hash, as Rails does: Rails' accessor
reverse-merges the declared defaults into the stored data the first time
it is read (and `before_save` reads it), so the object is one entry per
schema key, typed — which is what the flat readers compute, gathered into
a literal by `synth_index_read`. Assigning the column a whole Hash —
`update!(settings: { … })`, `new(settings: { … })`, `self[:settings] =
{ … }`, Rails' `settings=` — is `assign_data_with_type_casting`: each
supplied key cast through its declared type and MERGED over the stored
object, a key outside the schema raising as the accessor's
`method_missing` does. The attrs-hash writers route the column through
`SchematizedJson.assign(@settings, value, { "restrict" => "boolean" })`
with the schema as data. The value stays untyped there on purpose: the
same writers carry hydration's serialized text (`from_row` assigns the
stored column straight through `[]=`), and the seam — ruby-family
runtime, where an `is_a?(Hash)` over an untyped value resolves — is what
tells the two shapes apart. The lowering cannot, and that is why the
test lives in the runtime rather than in generated per-model code.

**Where it is still visible.** `attributes` keeps the serialized text
(the STORAGE view, as `created_at` reads back through it as raw ISO
text), and an integer key gets no `?` predicate, because Rails'
`present?` on any Integer — `0` included — is unconditionally true, and a
method that always answers the same thing is worse than an honest gap.
The permit-list path is a separate, ledgered gap: `permit(:name,
settings: {})` drops the nested key from the typed params class under
the `params_nested_filter` warning, so a form's settings never reach
`update_from_<params>!` — the attrs-Hash writers above are the ones that
model the assignment.

Analyze additionally types the column reader `untyped` where the emitted
reader returns `String`: that is the source-shaped accessor object, and
it exists only between the two hops the lowering erases.

### `insert_all` runs save callbacks and issues one INSERT per row

`Model.insert_all(rows)` is INLINED at the call site (Ruby family,
`scope_chain.rs`) as `rows.each { |a| Model.new(a)
.save_after_validation }`. Rails issues ONE multi-row INSERT and skips
validations *and* callbacks; this skips validations and their callbacks,
fills timestamps, and runs the save callbacks.

**Why `save_after_validation`.** It is the seam Rails' own
validation-skipping writes (`update_attribute`) already enter at, so
this reuses one definition of "write without validating" rather than
adding a second path that has to be kept in step.

**Why inlined, not a synthesized method.** A per-model `insert_all`
would land on every model of every app to serve the handful that call
it, and its parameter is an untyped attribute Hash — the shape the
has_json work established no target's Hash surface resolves portably. A
shared `ActiveRecord::Base` version is worse still: it would call
`new(attrs)` polymorphically against a `Base#initialize` taking no
attributes, in a file that prices every target. Inlining costs nothing
to an app that never calls it, and leaves strict targets an honest
unsupported diagnostic rather than a method that compiles and misbehaves.

**Conflicts are SKIPPED, and that took a fix.** Measured against
ActiveRecord 8.1.3: `insert_all` renders `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO
NOTHING`, so a row that already exists is a silent no-op — only
`insert_all!` raises `RecordNotUnique`. A bare per-row save raises, i.e.
it implemented `insert_all!` under the other name, and campfire's
`memberships.revise` (re-granting a membership to a user who already has
one) died on a UNIQUE index where Rails does nothing at all. Each row is
now guarded by an existence check on the table's unique keys, built from
the schema by `lower::scope_chain::build_unique_keys`.

The guard is a pre-check, not the database's atomic `DO NOTHING` — the
same read-then-write shape `increment!` below already carries, and under
single-threaded dispatch the window it opens is not observable. A unique
index over a NULLABLE column is skipped when building the guard:
`where(col: nil)` asks whether a row holds SQL NULL, which is a
different question, and in SQLite such rows never conflict anyway. A
partial unique index (`where:`) adds its predicate to the check,
`.where("(revoked_at IS NULL)")`, so only a row the index covers counts
as a conflict. The check reads the existing row, not the new one, so a
new row the predicate does not cover is still skipped when a covered row
shares its key; Rails inserts it.

**What it costs.** N statements instead of one, plus one SELECT per row
for the conflict check, and callbacks Rails would not run — visible on
any model whose `after_create` has side effects. The corpus caller
(campfire's `Room has_many :memberships do def grant_to … end end`)
inserts Membership rows whose callbacks are inert.

**And it answers a different value.** Rails returns an
`ActiveRecord::Result`; the inlined `rows.each { … }` returns `rows`,
the Array of attribute hashes it was given. The catalog says
`ArrayOfUntyped` for that reason — the type of what this pipeline
actually produces, not of what Rails produces. Both corpus call sites
discard the value. Saying nothing was not the neutral choice: a catalog
entry carrying no return kind falls through to the same place an
UNKNOWN method name does, so campfire's `Membership.insert_all(…)`
reported `no known method insert_all on Class { Membership }` while the
emitted code was the inlined loop, correct all along.

### `Current.reset` replaces the instance instead of nilling it

`ingest::current_attributes` turns `class Current <
ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes` into a plain singleton, and `reset`
used to set the slot to nil. Rails' `CurrentAttributes.reset` puts every
attribute back to its default, which a fresh instance also does — so at
runtime the two agree, at the cost of one allocation per request.

They do not agree in the type system, and that is why it changed.
`@__instance`'s type is the union of what the class assigns it, so the
single `= nil` made `self.instance` answer `Current | Nil`; the
class-level forwarders are all `Current.instance.<name>`, so every one
of them registered `Untyped`; and campfire routes essentially all
per-request state through those forwarders. One `nil` in a synthesized
method, and `Current.user.rooms` — plus every ivar downstream of one —
had no shape.

**`Current.<attr>` keeps its Nil arm**, unlike the controller-wide ivar
seed, which strips it. The write sites are the seed (`Current.user =
bot` in the authentication concern says `User | Nil`), and something
reads that arm: `def signed_in?; Current.user.present?; end` folds to
the constant `true` against a non-nilable type — a correct fold of an
incorrect type, which signed every visitor in and stopped the join-code
page from 404ing. A lie the type system can act on is worse than a gap.

### `list.many?` becomes `ActiveSupport.many?(list)`

Another `Enumerable` core_ext reopen the transpiled runtimes cannot host
— same home and same rule as `index_by` beside it, the receiver
evaluated exactly once. Rails writes the no-block form as a
short-circuiting `any?` with a counter so it stops at the second hit;
the receivers that reach here are already materialized, so `length > 1`
answers the same question.

The BLOCK form (`many? { … }`) is not rewritten: it counts matches
rather than elements, which is a different question no corpus app asks,
so it stays visible. Neither is a receiver that is not an `Array` —
`ActiveSupport.many?` names an Array parameter, and a Relation has its
own surface.

### `hash.to_json` becomes `JSON.generate(hash)`

`Hash#to_json` is a core_ext reopen — Ruby's json library adds it,
ActiveSupport replaces it — and a reopened builtin is the one shape no
strict target can host and spinel cannot dispatch on. `lower::to_json`
rewrites it to the bundled JSON package every emitted tree already
requires, which takes the same collection and answers the same String.

The gate is the receiver's type: `Ty::Hash` or `Ty::Array` only. A MODEL
receiver is deliberately excluded — `record.to_json` is Rails'
`as_json`-then-encode, which the `as_json_*` passes own and which
answers the model's declared shape rather than its ivars — and so is an
untyped receiver, where the rewrite would be a guess.

**The divergence:** ActiveSupport walks `as_json` first, so a `Time`
value renders in Rails' ISO-8601 form where `JSON.generate` refuses it.
The corpus receiver (campfire's `Webhook#payload`, which is the entire
request body a bot receives) holds strings, integers and nested hashes
of the same; a value JSON cannot encode raises rather than rendering
wrongly.

**Inline `render json: <object>` is written down, not walked.** Rails
encodes a plain object through `Object#as_json` — `instance_values`,
reflection over every ivar — and then a structural walk of the Hash.
The CRuby overlay's `ActionController::JsonRender.encode` reproduces
that walk (`respond_to?(:as_json)`, `case … when Hash`), and it is
CRuby-only by nature: on a compiled tree the constant is unresolved and
the site is a 500 (campfire's `POST /unfurl_links`, every pasted link).
The compiler already knows the key set — it is the class's declared
`attr_*` readers — so `lower::as_json_poro` writes both halves down: an
`as_json` Hash over those readers, and an `as_json_str` writer in the
same `io << "\"title\":" << JsonBuilder.encode_value(…)` accumulator
shape jbuilder templates lower to. The site becomes the Rails idiom for
an already-encoded body, `render plain: v.as_json_str, content_type:
"application/json"`, which the controller rewrite lowers on every
target; `JsonBuilder` is shared runtime, so the ruby lane runs the very
writer the compiled lane does. Demand-gated and type-gated: only a class
the analyzer typed at a `render json:` site is given the pair. A value
with no writer — a collection containing objects or temporal values, a Relation, a class with its own
`as_json` (whose pairs `as_json_shape` recognizes but whose computed
values are not yet typed, see that module) — keeps the runtime
encoder, CRuby-only and loud elsewhere; the suite ledger's
`render-json-encoder` rule is the tripwire for it.

Inline Hash/Array payloads whose inferred contents are JSON primitives use
the target's existing `JSON.generate` encoder, including nested primitive
collections. The shared `JsonBuilder.escape_html_entities` helper then
escapes `<`, `>` and `&` to their JSON Unicode forms, matching Rails' default
HTML-entity escaping without re-escaping the encoded document. Unknown values
and values requiring Rails `as_json` hooks do not take this path. The generic
`render_json_primitives` regression runs on CRuby and compiled Spinel, checks
the exact bytes for `<b>&</b>`, and retains a CRuby nested-Time serialization
control.

Remaining divergences: non-finite Float values (NaN and positive/negative
Infinity) still raise `JSON::GeneratorError` instead of Rails' `null` because
this path delegates primitive encoding to `JSON.generate`. The helper applies
the Rails 8.1+ defaults: HTML-entity escaping enabled, U+2028/U+2029 escaping
disabled. Per-application changes to those Rails encoder settings are not
reflected here.

### Active Storage: rows and bytes are modeled, variants are a seam

`runtime/ruby/active_storage.rb` models the attachment ROWS and the
BLOB (`ActiveStorage::Blob`: key, filename, content type, byte size,
the `metadata` column's width/height); `ActiveStorage::Service` is the
bytes seam, whose methods RAISE in the shared runtime (it does no file
I/O) and are reopened by the ruby family in
`runtime/spinel/active_storage_disk.rb` with Rails' own
`storage/files/<xx>/<yy>/<key>` disk layout (`tmp/storage` under
RAILS_ENV=test). `Blob.create_and_upload!` writes the row and hands the
bytes to the service; `Attached#attach` / `attach_blob` write the
attachment row. A `has_one_attached` model gets an `<attr>=` writer
(`lower::attached`) that stages an attachable — an
`ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile` from a multipart part, a `Blob`, a
signed id — and an `after_save` that attaches it once the record has
an id, so `create!(attachment: file)`, `update!(avatar: file)` and a
permitted `:avatar` param all reach the store.

**Variants are Rails' `VariantWithRecord`; the pixels are a seam.** The
`has_one_attached … do |attachable| attachable.variant :thumb,
resize_to_limit: [w, h], format: :webp end` block is lowered into the
reader's constructor as `ActiveStorage::Variation` values
(`lower::attached`; the dimensions ride as the expressions the source
wrote, so a concern's constant resolves inside the model that includes
it). `variant(:thumb)` answers a `VariantWithRecord` over the blob and
that variation; `.processed` finds the `active_storage_variant_records`
row by `(blob_id, variation_digest)` or makes it — download,
`ActiveStorage::Processor.transform`, `Blob.create_and_upload!`, the
record and its `image` attachment row — exactly Rails' find-or-create.
`Processor` RAISES in the shared runtime (decoding an image is not
something it can do, and serving the original under a thumbnail's name
would be the failure that looks like success); the ruby family reopens
it over ruby-vips — `runtime/spinel/facades/active_storage_processor
_vips.rb`, swapped in for the comment-only `runtime/active_storage
_processor.rb` by `project.rs` when the app declares any variant, with
`ruby-vips` added to `spin.toml` (the spinel-ruby-vips spin package, a
subset of the gem over the system libvips) or the Gemfile (the gem).
`resize_to_limit` / `resize_to_fit` lower (libvips `thumbnail`, fit
within, never enlarge); `resize_to_fill`, `rotate` and saver options do
not, and a variant carrying one is left undeclared so the runtime's
`ArgumentError` names it. A variation with no `format:` keeps a web
image's own format and transcodes anything else to PNG, Rails'
`default_variant_format`. The representation route carries
`Variation#encode` where Rails carries a signed transformation key,
decodes it and processes on request, as Rails' controller does; the
digest is that same encoding, so a database shared with a Rails
process keeps one record per digest scheme. Purging a blob purges its
variant records, their image blobs and their files first. The app's
libvips loader policy (`Vips.block_untrusted(true)`, `Vips.block(op,
true)` in an initializer) is lifted at ingest onto the `Rails
::Application` reopen and applied when the processor loads. The
processor also wraps `Vips.vips_foreign_find_load` so a blocked
loader is not selected: libvips 8.15+ skips BLOCKED classes in
`vips_foreign_map`, but 8.14 still names Magick/Svg after
`block_untrusted` even though load itself raises. The wrap reaches
the C finder through `VipsExt` (the spinel package's binding, or an
FFI stand-in on the gem). Wrapping the Ruby finder in place re-enters
the wrapper on the spinel package. `variable?`
is Rails' content-type question, answered from `variable_content_types`
minus what the app's initializer subtracts (ingest lifts
`config.active_storage.variable_content_types -= %w[…]` onto the same
reopen), so a bmp avatar falls back to initials exactly as in campfire.
`preview` (a video poster) is Rails' `Preview`: the poster is drawn once
by `ActiveStorage::Previewer.poster` — the ruby family's reopen runs the
same ffmpeg command Rails' `VideoPreviewer` does, with the same frame-
selection filter (`runtime/spinel/active_storage_previewer.rb`) — stored
as the blob's own `preview_image` attachment, and served as a VARIANT of
that image under the transformations the call named (`preview(format:
:webp, resize_to_limit: [w, h])`, which `lower::attached` turns into a
`Variation` at the site). `previewable?` is `video?`; a PDF has no
previewer here. ffmpeg is a runtime prerequisite the way libvips is:
campfire's Dockerfile installs it, so does the archive's, and the
conformance job. Without it the previewer raises, as Rails does. The
image DIMENSIONS are read from the file header at upload
(`ImageAnalyzer`, ruby family: PNG/GIF/JPEG/BMP/WebP), so
`metadata[:width]` answers what Rails' analyzer would.

**Where the preview still differs.** `representation(...)` answers the
variant whatever the blob is, where Rails answers a `Preview` for a
previewable one — kept so the reader has one type (a union would box
every image on the room page); campfire only asks for a representation
off its `video?`-guarded branch. The account-logo tests that decode the
served PNG and assert 512×512 / 192×192 pass on both lanes, on the real
variant's bytes — the numbers ruby-vips and the port answer for the
same input are byte-identical (spinel-ruby-vips' oracle lane holds it
to that).

### The query cache replays results of at most 16 rows

Rails' per-request query cache keeps every SELECT's result and replays
an identical SELECT from it. The three ruby-family Db shims keep the
same discipline with one bound: a result that grows past
`QC_CAPTURE_ROWS` (16) is not kept, and an identical SELECT later in the
same request runs again rather than replaying. The lookups a page
repeats — campfire's `Account.first` 22 times on a room page, a
message's `room` 20 times — are a row each and replay exactly as before;
what changed is that the 100-message and 100-rich-text results are no
longer copied cell by cell for a replay nothing asks for (measured:
~2,700 String allocations per `/rooms/1` request, a quarter of the
total). The only observable difference from Rails is a repeated
large SELECT within one request costing a round trip, which
`capture_sql` would count where Rails' SQLCounter would not.

### A QR code is the gem's bytes, on every ruby-family lane

`RQRCode::QRCode.new(text).as_svg(…)` — campfire's `QrCodeController`
renders a room's join link this way, lobsters its 2FA enrollment — was a
raising façade on spinel (`runtime/ruby/rqrcode_facade.rb`, the
write-path rule every gem façade follows) and the real gem on CRuby and
JRuby. It is now real on spinel too: when an app names `RQRCode`,
`spin_shape` swaps the façade file for `require "rqrcode"` and declares
the spinel-rqrcode spin package (github.com/rubys/spinel-rqrcode;
matz/spin-index#8 is the registration, so the manifest uses the git form
until it merges), the same seam bcrypt and ruby-vips use.

The package carries its encoder — Project Nayuki's QR-Code-generator,
the single MIT-licensed C file Debian ships as libqrcodegen — so unlike
ruby-vips it asks nothing of the machine. **Its output is byte-identical
to the gem's**, and that took two rules, not a library swap: Nayuki's
encoder and rqrcode_core agree on the modules for a given text, level,
version and mask, but the gem picks its VERSION with a strict-less-than
against capacity (an exact fit goes up a version) and its MASK with its
own penalty scoring on a matrix whose format/version modules are blank.
The package's glue reproduces both, and its oracle lane holds the
compiled port to the gem across three modes, four levels and versions
1–35 (a randomised 800-pair sweep across 1–40 agreed while it was
built). Measured on the compiled campfire binary: `GET /qr_code/:id`
serves the same 24,518 bytes the gem renders for the same link.

What is still not on the wire from that endpoint is the `Cache-Control`
header — `expires_in` records it and emits nothing, the entry below —
which the suite's test reads through the harness rather than the wire.

### `ActionCable.server` exists; the registry did not say so

`runtime/spinel/action_cable.rb` has had `ActionCable.server`,
`Server#broadcast`, `#remote_connections`, `RemoteConnections#where` and
`RemoteConnection#disconnect` since the cable work. None was in the
analyzer's class registry, so campfire's
`User#close_remote_connections` — the one caller — read out as
`no known method server on Class { ActionCable }` about a chain the
emitted tree resolves. Registered, not implemented: the divergence that
the selected connection set is always EMPTY is recorded with the cable
notes, unchanged.

### `IPAddr` is a port, and it rejects a prefix

`runtime/ruby/ipaddr.rb` implements the slice of Ruby's stdlib class the
corpus reaches: `IPAddr.new(str)`, `loopback?`, `private?`,
`link_local?`, `ipv4?`/`ipv6?`/`ipv4_mapped?`, `to_s`, and
`IPAddr::InvalidAddressError`. campfire's `Ban#ip_address_is_public`
is the caller.

**The rule table is the stdlib's, verbatim** — every prefix copied from
ipaddr.rb's own masks and comments (127.0.0.0/8; 10.0.0.0/8,
172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16, fc00::/7; 169.254.0.0/16, fe80::/10; and
the IPv4-mapped form of each). Deriving them would be the inflector
mistake in a more expensive place: an address wrongly called public is a
ban that does not take, and nothing raises. `runtime/ruby/test/
ipaddr_test.rb` asserts the stdlib's own answers over 42 addresses that
sit on both sides of every boundary, generated by running Ruby's
`IPAddr` over the list.

**The representation is not the stdlib's.** Ruby keeps one Integer,
128 bits wide for IPv6; no strict target has that, and a bignum here
would cost nine runtimes a primitive to answer three predicates. The
port keeps octets — every rule in the table is a prefix test, so they
answer it exactly as well.

**What it does not do**, and where that shows: no prefix/netmask
(`IPAddr.new("10.0.0.0/8")` raises `InvalidAddressError` where Ruby
masks the address), no `include?`/`to_range`/`succ`/arithmetic, and
`to_s` renders IPv6 uncompressed. Rejecting a prefix loudly is the
deliberate choice over answering about `10.0.0.0` when the caller wrote
`10.0.0.0/8`.

**The CRuby and JRuby trees get Ruby's own instead.** `project::
ruby_runtime_files` rewrites the emitted tree's ipaddr.rb to a one-line
`require "ipaddr"` — the same "one require path, target-appropriate
implementation" split the emitted db.rb carries
(`runtime/spinel/db_cruby.rb` here). That is not tidiness:
something on the CRuby side already loads the stdlib's ipaddr, and two
definitions of `IPAddr::InvalidAddressError` with different superclasses
is a `TypeError: superclass mismatch` at REQUIRE time. campfire's suite
went 219/240 to 0/240 on it, every file dying on the same line.

### `Random.uuid` reads the CSPRNG, not the PRNG

`securerandom.rb` defines one module, `Random::Formatter`, and extends
BOTH `Random` and `SecureRandom` with it — `uuid` is the same code
either way, and only the byte source underneath differs. (It is also why
`Random.uuid` is undefined until something requires securerandom;
campfire's `Message#client_message_id ||= Random.uuid` works because
Rails already has.) Nothing on any target defines it, so
`lower::random_formatter` rewrites the receiver to `SecureRandom`, the
name the emitted tree already carries.

The divergence is the generator: Rails' call reads `Random`'s default
Mersenne Twister, ours reads the OS CSPRNG. The value is a v4 UUID
string either way and every consumer treats it as an opaque id, so this
is the safe direction — but an app that wanted a *reproducible* uuid out
of a seeded `Random` would not get one. Only the names `Random` cannot
answer on its own are rewritten: `Random.rand`, `Random.bytes`,
`Random.new_seed`, `Random.srand` and `Random.random_number` are real
methods on the PRNG class with their own meaning.

### `increment!` / `decrement!` are read-modify-write, not atomic

Rails issues `UPDATE … SET col = col + 1`, so two concurrent callers
both land. `lower::column_ops` rewrites the call site to `self.col =
self.col + 1; touch`, which reads, adds and writes — the same answer
with one writer, a LOST UPDATE with two.

**Why the call site at all.** The alternative is a shared
`increment!(name, by, touch:)`, whose column parameter means
`self[name] = …` — an index write through a variable key, the shape
that keeps `touch` no-arg (see below). At the call site the column is a
literal, so the write is an ordinary typed attribute assignment.

Only the `touch: true` spelling is claimed, which is what the corpus
writes. The bare `increment!(:col)` keeps its NoMethodError: reproducing
it would mean persisting the counter WITHOUT stamping `updated_at`, and
a silently wrong timestamp is worse than a missing method.

### `belongs_to … touch:` cascades, and `touch` fires `after_touch`

`lower::model_to_library::markers` expands the option onto the four
hooks Rails registers it on — `after_create`, `after_update`,
`after_destroy` and `after_touch` — each binding the belongs_to reader
to a local, guarding it for nil and calling the parent's no-arg
`touch`. `touch: :some_column` stamps that column through its writer
first, from `ActiveSupport.db_now`, so it and `updated_at` carry one
instant.

`after_touch` is the load-bearing one. It is what makes the cascade
TRANSITIVE, and `ActiveRecord::Base#touch` fires it: campfire's boost
touches its Message, whose own `belongs_to :room, touch: true` carries
the stamp on to the Room. Without it the chain stops one level short —
and no behavioral test can see that, because nothing renders
`updated_at`. What does see it is a fragment cache keyed on
`cache_key_with_version`.

Two residues, both smaller than they look:

* **`touch` still runs no COMMIT callbacks.** Rails fires
  `after_commit` (and the `_commit` variants) after a touch; this
  runtime fires `after_touch` only.
* **The update hook is unguarded.** Rails registers its touch with
  `if: :saved_changes?` and skips the parent when the child's save
  changed nothing. This runtime's `save` issues an unconditional
  UPDATE, so there is no no-op save for the guard to catch and the
  condition would never be false. A save that writes the same bytes
  therefore moves the parent's `updated_at` where Rails leaves it —
  which busts a cache entry early rather than serving a stale one.

Rails also SKIPS the create and destroy registrations when the
association carries a `counter_cache:` (the counter update touches on
its own). This runtime has no counter-cache support, so it registers
all four unconditionally, which reaches the same observable row.

### A bad signed id raises `RecordNotFound`, not `InvalidSignature`

`record.signed_id(purpose:)` and `Model.find_signed(id, purpose:)` are
rewritten at the call site by `lower::signed_id` — Rails'
`combine_signed_id_purposes` reads `self.class.name`, and this runtime
is deliberately reflection-free, so the model name is folded into the
purpose string at compile time (`signed_id(purpose: :avatar)` in
`User::Avatar` becomes the literal `"user/avatar"`).

The WIRE FORMAT is not a divergence: `ActiveRecord::SignedId` signs
through the same envelope the cookie jar uses, and
`runtime/ruby/test/action_controller/message_verifier_test.rb` pins the
emitted bytes against tokens minted by a real ActiveSupport 8.1.3. A
token this runtime writes is one Rails reads, and vice versa — which is
what a migration needs, because campfire puts a signed id in the URL of
every rendered avatar.

What diverges is the FAILURE. `ActiveRecord::SignedId.verified_id`
answers `0` for a token that does not verify — tampered, wrong purpose,
or expired — the same non-nil-sentinel posture as the verifier's `""`.
The lowered `find_signed!` is therefore `Model.find(0)`, which raises
`ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound` where Rails raises
`ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier::InvalidSignature`.

**CLOSED for the BANG form.** `find_signed!` verifies through
`SignedId.verified_id!`, which raises
`ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier::InvalidSignature` for a token that does
not verify and leaves `RecordNotFound` to a token that DOES and names no
row — Rails' own split. The name is the whole point: campfire's
`Users::AvatarsController` rescues the signature error BY NAME over an
avatar URL carrying a signed id, and against a `RecordNotFound` that
rescue never fired.

**Still divergent:** the non-bang `find_signed` reads the same `0`
sentinel through `find_by(id: 0)`, which answers nil — the same answer
Rails gives, by a different route. A row whose id really is `0` would
be indistinguishable, and no schema here mints one.

Rails' `expires_at:` (an absolute instant) is not claimed; only
`expires_in:`. A call passing it is left alone rather than rewritten,
so it fails by name instead of silently minting a token that never
expires.

### `has_secure_password`'s reset token: only the default is claimed

`has_secure_password` generates `<attr>_reset_token`,
`find_by_<attr>_reset_token(!)` and `<attr>_reset_token_expires_in`
(`lower::secure_password`, over `runtime/ruby/active_record/token_for.rb`).
The WIRE FORMAT is Rails' own, and `tests/rails8_authentication.rs` holds
it to a token minted by Rails 8.1.4: the signed-GlobalID envelope (url-safe
base64 with padding, HMAC-SHA1) under the `active_record/token_for` salt,
data `[id, password_salt.last(10)]`, purpose `"User\npassword_reset\n900"`.

Only `reset_token: true`, the default, is reproduced. `reset_token: false`
defines nothing, as in Rails; a custom `expires_in:` hash is left without
methods rather than given the default lifetime. General
`generates_token_for :purpose do … end` is still analyzer-typed with no
runtime. `<attr>_reset_token_expires_in` answers the Integer `900` where
Rails answers the Duration `15.minutes`; every reader in the generator
takes seconds.

### `normalizes` also applies to rows loaded from the database

`normalizes :email_address, with: ->(e) { … }` (`lower::normalizes`)
becomes `Model._normalize_<attr>(value)`, called by the column writer and
wrapped around the matching keyword of `find_by`/`where`/`exists?`/
`find_or_*_by`. Hydration assigns through that same writer, so a row
loaded from the database is normalized too, where Rails leaves an
existing row alone until the attribute is reassigned. The two agree on
every row the app wrote after the declaration. A `with:` that is not a
one-parameter lambda literal, and `apply_to_nil: true`, are not
reproduced (the declaration is left without effect).

### The mail assertions count deliveries

`assert_enqueued_emails` and `assert_enqueued_email_with` read
`ActionMailer::Base.deliveries`, which `deliver_later` appends to
immediately (there is no queue in one process). So a `deliver_now`
counts as enqueued too, and `assert_enqueued_email_with` checks that a
mail went out, not the mailer, action, or arguments — the narrowing
`assert_enqueued_with` already documents for jobs.

### `remote_connections.disconnect` selects an empty set

`ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(current_user: user)
.disconnect` returns without closing anything. A remote connection is
selected by its connection *identifiers*, and no connection in this
runtime ever registers one: Turbo's streams subscribe by signed stream
name through `Cable::Connection#handle_message`, and channel
subscription dispatch — the half that would run `identified_by
:current_user` — is not implemented. The selected set is genuinely
empty, so the no-op is accurate rather than a stub.

**What it costs.** campfire calls this from `User#deactivate` and
`User#reset_remote_connections`: a deactivated or banned user's live
socket stays open. Nothing in the corpus's own tests can observe it
(they assert on the database rows the same method deletes), which is
exactly why it is written down here. When subscription dispatch lands,
`ActionCable::RemoteConnections#where` is where the real selection goes.

### A raw cable payload is JSON TEXT on spinel, a Hash on CRuby

`ActionCable.server.broadcast(stream, payload)` — the low-level publish
that is NOT the Turbo Stream family — carries its payload differently on
the two Action Cable substrates.

The CRuby overlay keeps the Ruby Hash the whole way to the transport and
lets it serialize. `runtime/spinel/action_cable.rb` cannot: a `payload`
parameter that must hold `{room_id: 1}` today and whatever the next app
writes tomorrow is exactly the untyped bag a strict target has no lane
for. So the Hash is rendered to JSON text at the boundary
(`ActionCable.payload_json`) and everything downstream carries String.
`Cable.publish_raw` splices that text UNQUOTED into the envelope's
`message` field, which is what keeps the wire shape a JSON *object*
rather than a JSON string — the silent failure the overlay's own header
warns about.

**What it costs.** `Broadcasts::LOG` records the rendered text where the
overlay records the Hash, so a test that reads `entry[:payload]` and
subscripts it passes on CRuby and does not on spinel. Both entries carry
`action: :message` and the stream, which is what `assert_broadcasts`
reads, so the test helper itself agrees across the two. The narrower
consequence is in the renderer: `payload_json` writes Integer values
only, because two call sites in one app is the whole surface anybody has
asked for. A String or nested value needs the renderer widened — and
that is a monomorphization decision to take deliberately, not a cast to
sneak in.

### Active Storage's engine routes are mounted by the dispatcher

Active Storage's route helpers are not in the app's `config/routes.rb`,
so the generator that reads it never emits them. `RouteHelpers
.rails_blob_path` / `_url` and `rails_representation_path` / `_url`
live on the `RouteHelpers` reopen in `runtime/ruby/active_storage.rb`
and answer Rails' own URL shapes:

    /rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/:signed_id/*filename
    /rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/:signed_blob_id/:variation_key/*filename
    /rails/active_storage/disk/:encoded_key/*filename

The three controllers behind them (`ActiveStorage::Blobs::
RedirectController`, `Representations::RedirectController`,
`DiskController`) are ruby-family runtime (`active_storage_disk.rb`);
`ActiveStorage::Routes.table` is appended to `Main.route_table` by
both dispatchers and the test harness, and their `instantiate_
controller` falls through to `ActiveStorage::Routes.instantiate_
controller` for a symbol no app arm names. The first two answer a 302
to the disk route, as Rails does; the disk route serves the bytes with
`Content-Disposition` (what makes a Download link download) and the
hour of public caching the app's initializer asks for. The router
gained `*glob` segments for the trailing filename.

Signed ids are the `signed_id` envelope under Active Storage's own
salt (`blob_id` for the blob, `disk_key` with a five-minute expiry
for the disk token); `Blob.find_signed` verifies them.

**Direct uploads.** The same table mounts Rails' direct-upload pair:

    POST /rails/active_storage/direct_uploads
    PUT  /rails/active_storage/disk/:encoded_token

`DirectUploadsController#create` allocates the row from what the
browser declared (`Blob.create_before_direct_upload!` — key, size,
MD5 checksum, type; no bytes yet) and answers Rails' JSON: the blob's
attributes, its `signed_id`, and under `direct_upload` the PUT url
and the `Content-Type` header to send. That url carries a second
token (`blob_token`) signing the key, type, length and checksum, and
`DiskController#update` holds the PUT to it: a token that does not
verify is a 404, a body whose type or length differs from the
declaration is a 422, and a checksum that does not match after the
write is Rails' `IntegrityError` — the file is removed and the answer
is 422. Both tokens are minted by `ActiveStorage::DiskKey`, which is
shared runtime (`runtime/ruby/active_storage.rb`) so that `Blob#url`
can be Rails' SERVICE url — the disk route, absolute — on every
target; only serving the routes is the ruby family's.

`Blob#url` is absolute through `ActiveStorage::Current.url_options`,
which the engine controllers set from the request (Rails'
`SetCurrent`) and a caller outside a request sets itself. Divergence,
named: Rails raises when the disk service is asked for a url with no
options set; here the url is path-only, which a browser resolves
against the page. The checksum is `Digest::MD5.base64digest` on both
lanes — spinel's `digest` package bound it the day it was asked for
(matz/spinel#4631, 00e00631); a pure-Ruby port stood in for one
commit.

**The guard.** Rails mounts these two endpoints on every app whether
or not its forms use direct uploads, so campfire — whose composer
uploads through `MessagesController` — guards them in
`config/initializers/active_storage_authentication.rb`: an `include`
of its session check into each controller and a `before_action` that
answers an anonymous caller 401. Both lines are the initializer's own
and both are performed. `lower::module_mixins` already kept an
`include`/`prepend` onto a runtime class it credits; it now keeps a
`before_action` too, when the target is a runtime controller that
asks `initializer_filters(action_name)` before its action (the two
direct-upload controllers) and a kept mixin onto that target defines
the method. The emit writes one reopen per target at the end of
`boot.rb` redefining that seam — `only:` rendered as the lowered
controllers spell it — so the framework controller runs the app's
filter with the app's cookies and models, on both lanes. A filter
nothing supplies is dropped and reported, as a dropped mixin is.

`url_for(attachment)` / `image_tag(attachment)` — Rails'
`polymorphic_url` on an attachment — are grounded at the call site by
`lower::attached_url`: an attachment-shaped argument (a `has_one_
attached` reader by NAME, or a variant chained off one) in a URL
position becomes `<expr>.url`, so the String-typed helper gets a
String. A helper parameter that only HOLDS one (campfire's
`broadcast_image_tag(image, …)`) reaches the ruby family's
`polymorphic_url` reopen, which narrows by class at run time.

**Multipart.** `runtime/spinel/multipart.rb` parses
`multipart/form-data` on both serving paths (tep's three body drains,
`CgiIo.parse_request`); file parts land in the params tree as
`UploadedFile` objects under their bracket-nested name, text parts as
Strings. `<Resource>Params` types a permitted `has_one_attached` field
as `UploadedFile?` and reads it through `UploadedFile.from_params` —
the one narrowing of a params value to that class, kept out of
`Params` because the strict targets' `ParamValue` union has no file
arm. `form_with` renders `enctype="multipart/form-data"` when its block
(or a partial the block renders) calls `file_field`, which is what
Rails' builder does for it. `ActionController::Base#headers` now reach
the wire on both dispatchers (nil values dropped — campfire's `X-Rev`
is an unset ENV outside its deploy).

### A `has_secure_token` column fills at CREATE, not at initialize

Rails 7.1+ defaults `has_secure_token` to `on: :initialize`, so
`Session.new.token` already holds a token. `lower::secure_token`
expands the macro into a `before_create` default instead, so the token
is readable from the moment the record is SAVED. Every corpus call site
reads it after a save, which is what a session token is for. `on:
:create` is exactly this lowering, and `on: :initialize` gets it too —
keeping half of Rails' own default would be the worse divergence.

The generator is `SecureRandom.alphanumeric(<length>)`, not Rails'
`SecureRandom.base58`: base58 is not core Ruby (it arrives with
`active_support/core_ext/securerandom`, which the emitted app does not
load), while `alphanumeric` is core and already carried by every target.
Same length, different alphabet.

**Why it matters that this expands at all.** A dropped
`has_secure_token` is not an absent method, it is a wrong column value:
this runtime defaults a string slot to `""`, so every unsaved record
carries the same token and the second INSERT dies on the table's UNIQUE
index.

### `assert_enqueued_with` checks the job, not its arguments

Rails matches both `job:` and `args:`. This runtime's helper
(`runtime/spinel/test/test_helper.rb`) matches the job class only.

**Why.** Matching the arguments needs the enqueue log to carry them, and
a record argument would then compare by object identity — the test's
fixture and the controller's freshly-loaded row are different objects
where Rails compares serialized GlobalIDs. A check that fails for the
wrong reason is worse than a narrower one that says so.

**What it costs.** A job enqueued with the RIGHT class and the WRONG
arguments passes here and fails in Rails. Nothing in the corpus depends
on the distinction today; campfire's one site asserts a ban job for a
user, and the class is unique to that path.

### A job enqueues under test and runs inline in the app

Rails picks its adapter per environment: `:test` enqueues without
running, the app's runs the job for real. This runtime does the same
with one seam. `lower::job_class_side` synthesizes

```text
def self.perform_later(a, b)
  ActiveJob.record_performed("X")
  new.perform(a, b) if !ActiveJob.enqueue_only
  nil
end
```

`ActiveJob::ENQUEUE_ONLY` is an empty suspension stack by default, so a
running app dispatches at the call site — there is no queue daemon
in-process, which is the `:inline` adapter's semantics. The emitted
test harness pushes onto that stack at load, so the suite enqueues.

**Why the difference is load-bearing.** campfire's `Message` carries
`after_create_commit -> { room.receive(self) }`, whose tail is
`Room::PushMessageJob.perform_later`. Under inline dispatch every
message a FIXTURE loads runs `Room::MessagePusher`, and the suite dies
in that job's unresolvable nested join before a single assertion runs.
Rails' own suite never reaches the code, for exactly this reason.

**What it costs.** `perform_later` answers `nil` rather than the
perform's value. Rails answers the job (or `false`), never the result,
so nothing portable reads it — and a Nil return is what lets the
guarded call sit in statement position instead of forcing a
`<perform-return> | nil` union on the strict targets.

`perform_now` is ungated in both environments: its Rails semantics is
already "run now".

**AND A SERVED APP IS THE THIRD ENVIRONMENT, which this framing missed.**
Rails' production adapter does not run the job in the request either — it
enqueues, and a worker runs it. Inline dispatch is therefore closest to
Rails only for an app with no queue at all; for campfire it puts
`Room::PushMessageJob` inside `POST /rooms/:id/messages`, where it dies on
`uninitialized constant Net::HTTP::Persistent` and 500s a request whose
broadcast had already gone out. `scripts/campfire-cable-walk` splices
`ActiveJob.enqueue_without_running` for that reason and says so in its
header. What this runtime does not have is the third option Rails
actually uses: enqueue now, run elsewhere, later.

### ActiveJob's test helpers count NAMES, and `perform_enqueued_jobs` re-enters inline

`ActiveJob::PERFORMED` is the queue-inspection seam, appended by the
`perform_later` wrapper before the adapter gate — so it is an ENQUEUE
log in both environments. It holds class NAMES, not arguments (a class
is not a first-class value on the strict targets, and the call sites
that name one are rewritten to the string by `lower::job_test_only`).

`perform_enqueued_jobs { … }` therefore cannot replay a queue: it holds
no arguments. It switches back to inline dispatch for the block
instead, so the jobs the block enqueues run as it enqueues them — the
same observable behaviour for a block that enqueues and then asserts,
and different only for one that enqueued BEFORE the block opened.

### A terminal must leave the relation as it found it

`pluck` / `ids` / `pick` set a projection (or a limit) on the relation
to build their query. They now RESTORE it. This is a note about an
invariant rather than a divergence, because the alternative was not a
divergence either — it was silent corruption.

**What it looked like.** `pluck` wrote `@select_sql = "users.id AS v"`
and left it there. The next `to_a` on that same object hydrated whole
records out of a one-column row: every field blank, every id `0`, no
error raised, nothing logged. campfire's
`Rooms::Direct.find_or_create_for` plucks user ids in `find_for` and
then hands the SAME relation to `grant_to`, which duly created
memberships for user 0.

**The invariant.** This Relation is deliberately mutate-and-return-self
for CHAIN methods (`where`, `order`, `limit` …) — the class doc says so,
and lowered chains rely on it. A TERMINAL is the other kind: it runs a
query and answers a value, and Rails builds it a query of its own. Any
terminal that has to touch relation state to build its SQL must put that
state back.

`first` and `find(id)` were the same shape and now restore too — `first`
puts the limit back and drops the one-row `@records` (a cache holding
the single row it asked for would answer a later `each` with one row out
of many), `find` pops its id predicate. Neither moved a test; they are
here so the invariant above has no known live exceptions.

The restore is not exception-safe: a raise inside the terminal leaves
the state set, because `begin`/`ensure` is not available in this file
(see the note on `Model.connection` in base.rb — the rescue-carrying
surface lives in the ruby-family `connection.rb` reopen). The push and
the pop are symmetric on every path that returns.

### A `has_many :through` reader is a live Relation — only here

`user.rooms`, `room.users`, `user.reachable_messages`: a reader for an
association declared `through:` returns an `ActiveRecord::Relation`, not
an Array of rows. Its declared type says so, and the chains campfire
writes on top of it — `Current.user.rooms.find_by(id: …)`,
`room.users.where.not(id: …)`, `Current.user.rooms.original` — resolve
against the relation surface because of it.

**Why.** The direct-fk query the shared lowering synthesizes for every
has_many (`Room.where(user_id: @id)`) is simply wrong when the key lives
on the join table, so the Ruby family rebuilds the body as
`ActiveRecord::Relation.new(Room).joins("INNER JOIN memberships …")
.where("memberships.user_id = ?", @id)`
(`emit::ruby::library::apply_through_assoc_lowering`). That rebuilt body
returns a relation. Declaring `Array[Room]` over it was a signature that
disagreed with the method, and nothing raised: `Current.user.rooms`
typed as an Array means `.find_by` is not a known method, so the
controller method wrapping it registered `-> untyped`, so the
route-param lowering had no model type to see and left the RECORD in the
path — `/rooms/#<Room:0x…>` where Rails writes `/rooms/1`.

**What it costs — and who pays.** The rebuild is Ruby-family only. Every
other target still carries the direct-fk body, which on Rust reads
`Story::where(category_id: self.id)` for lobsters'
`has_many :stories, through: :tags` — a column `stories` does not have.
That emit compiled and returned the wrong rows. With the reader typed
`Ty::Relation`, those targets now meet a relation at emit and report
`relation_type` unsupported instead, which is the ledger doing its job:
a named gap where there was a silent wrong answer. Closing it means
moving the through rebuild into the shared lowering, where every target
gets the join.

### Conditional GET is ALWAYS FRESH

`fresh_when(record)` is a no-op and `stale?(etag:)` answers `true`, so
every conditional-GET request renders instead of ever answering 304.

**Why.** Both halves of Rails' comparison are missing. The controller
has no request object — only `@request_format` — so there is nothing to
read `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since` FROM, and the extra-header
hash on the buffered response is never sent by the CGI harness, so
there is nothing to write `ETag` / `Last-Modified` TO. Wiring either
one is a change to the harness, not to this method.

**What it costs.** Bandwidth, not behavior. Always-render is the answer
Rails itself gives when a client sends no conditional header, so no
response is ever WRONG — the 304 is simply never earned. That is why
this can ship ahead of the plumbing, where a raise or a missing method
could not: three campfire controllers gate real work on `stale?`, and
without it they answered nothing at all.

**Shape.** Monomorphic on what the corpus writes — `fresh_when
@messages`, `stale?(etag: record)`. Rails accepts more
(`fresh_when(etag:, last_modified:)`, `stale?(record)`); each gets its
own method here when a call site asks, rather than one method with a
union parameter no strict target can narrow. `fresh_when`'s body is
EMPTY rather than a bare `nil` — a lone `nil` gives Rust an `Option`
with nothing to infer from (`E0282` on `None;`), where an empty body is
a plain `void`.

### `expires_in` records Cache-Control but emits no header

`expires_in 1.year, public: true` records the max-age and the
public/private flag on the controller and stops there. No
`Cache-Control` header is produced, so a real client is told nothing
about caching and re-fetches every time.

**Why.** The same unsent extra-header seam the conditional-GET entry
above describes, approached from the writing side rather than the
reading side: the CGI harness emits status, body and content type, and
nothing else. Composing the header string into the buffered `headers`
hash ahead of that would be work nothing reads — and `@headers[k] = v`
does not survive the Rust emitter, which renders a Hash index-assign as
`self.headers[k] = v` where `HashMap` wants `.insert()` (E0594:
`IndexMut` is not implemented for `HashMap`). That emitter gap is worth
closing on its own; it is not worth carrying dead code to reach.

**What it costs.** Bandwidth, and only bandwidth — an uncached response
is a correct response. Nothing an app does depends on the client
honoring it.

**Where a test differs from a client.** `response.cache_control` reads
the controller's recorded values directly, not a parsed header, so a
test asserting `cache_control[:max_age]` sees the right answer while an
HTTP client sees no header at all. That is the honest reading of what is
implemented: the VALUE is computed, the TRANSPORT is not.

`stale_while_revalidate:` is accepted and recorded nowhere for the same
reason — it exists so that campfire's logos and avatars actions, two of
its three call sites, do not raise ArgumentError on an option this
method would otherwise not know.

**Shape.** Rails' `response.cache_control` is `{public: true, max_age:
31556952}` — an Integer and a boolean in one Hash, the type bag every
strict target pays for. The controller keeps the two facts apart as
`cache_control_max_age` (Integer) and `cache_control_public` (bool), and
only the TEST harness reassembles Rails' Hash, since the subscript
spelling is what a test writes and the harness ships to the Ruby family
alone. The rest of Rails' options (`must_revalidate:`,
`stale_if_error:`) join `stale_while_revalidate:` when a call site asks,
rather than as a splat nothing can type. The seconds argument is
grounded at the CALL SITE by `lower::duration::rewrite_expires_in` —
the same `.to_i` unwrap `signed_id(expires_in:)` gets — so the runtime
signature stays `Integer` and no strict target pays for an `untyped`
parameter.

### `Relation#find` raises `RecordNotFound` — as Rails does

Recorded because it USED to answer `nil`, and code written against the
old behavior would now see the raise.

`find(id)` raises when there is no such row; `find_by(conditions)` still
answers nil. That is Rails' own split, and the raise is what turns a
missing record into a 404 rather than a nil that NoMethodErrors a few
frames later — campfire's `Current.user.rooms.find(params[:room_id])
.users` on a non-member room read "undefined method 'users' for nil",
against a test asserting `assert_raises ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound`.

**Still divergent:** the message. Rails names the model and the id
(`Couldn't find Room with 'id'=3`); this names the TABLE, because the
model is held as an untyped class value here and reading `.name` off it
would make the message a gradual site.

### `ActiveRecord::Relation` has no `new`

Rails builds a record through a relation — `User.active_bots.new`,
`room.memberships.new` — seeded from the relation's equality conditions.
There is no `Relation#new` here, and there cannot be one.

**Why.** Under spinel a class's constructor is already
`sp_<Class>_new`, so an instance method named `new` on `Relation`
compiles to a second `sp_Relation_new` and the C compiler rejects the
program outright (`conflicting types for 'sp_Relation_new'`). The name
is spoken for on any target that derives a constructor symbol from the
class name; a runtime method cannot claim it. Measured, not predicted:
one landed briefly and turned every spinel job red.

**What it costs.** Nothing at the call sites the corpus writes, because
the call never reaches a method: `lower::scope_chain` rewrites it away.
Inside an association-scoped class method, `new` becomes
`new(__rel.scope_attributes)` — that is where `user.sessions.create!`
gets its `user_id`. On a relation-valued RECEIVER, the same rewrite one
layer out moves the constructor to the model:

```text
User.active_bots.new         ->  User.new(User.active_bots.scope_attributes)
room.memberships.new(attrs)  ->  Membership.new(__rel.scope_attributes.merge(attrs))
```

The receiver stays where it is — a relation is lazy, so reading
`scope_attributes` off it runs no query — and the caller's own
attributes ride on the OUTSIDE of the merge, which is Rails' order.

**Supported find-or-create subset:** a concrete model, or a chain of
`Model.where(column: scalar_literal)` calls, followed by
`find_or_create_by` / `find_or_create_by!` with a literal Symbol-keyed
scalar conditions Hash, is expanded at the call site. Keys must be
ordinary schema columns (not the primary key) and literal types must fit
the column; this pass does not cast attributes. The lookup retains every
predicate. On a miss, the concrete constructor receives a typed literal
Hash of the scope defaults and the explicit conditions (which win), so
supported constructor callbacks (block-form `after_initialize`, or an
instance `after_initialize` method) see the initialized attributes. A
directly attached single-parameter initialization block runs only for a
new record, before validation/save; an existing match is returned
without yielding. Supported positions are a statement, a local or
instance-variable assignment, or the whole method body. Shadowing an
outer local with the initialization parameter, or rebinding that
parameter, still returns the original saved record.

**Still divergent:** the general create seed. Rails' `scope_for_create`
is `where_values_hash`, so EVERY equality condition on the relation
pre-fills the record; the runtime still records only an association
seed (`where_scope`). `User.active_bots.new` comes back without its
`role`.

Outside the find-or-create subset, each with an explicit error:

- `find_or_create_by!` with nonliteral conditions — the runtime has no
  bang form;
- general relations, associations, and nonliteral, collection, OR or
  range predicates (OR/removed predicates are not guessed from an old
  create seed);
- initialization blocks with control flow, compound or parallel
  assignment, new local variables, rescue exception bindings, nested
  blocks, or rest/block parameters;
- block locals and optional, post, keyword, block and anonymous-rest
  parameters, rejected at ingest before their unrepresented signature
  fields are lost;
- forwarded initialization blocks (`&proc`, `&lambda`, `&->` and other
  block arguments);
- effectful attribute or index assignment targets.

Symbol-form `after_initialize` callbacks are not yet lowered and keep a
model out of this path. Blockless non-bang lowering and the runtime
association finders are unchanged. An argument shape the
plain-constructor rewrite does not admit — a positional value, a splat —
is left alone and still raises.

### A scope-INDIFFERENT class method runs unscoped

Rails runs `User.active.find_by_transfer_id(id)` with the relation as
the current scope, so any query the body makes is filtered by it. Here
the call reaches a class method that some call site named through a
relation chain (`scope_chain::collect_relation_class_method_demand`),
and the method grows the same trailing `__rel` an association-scoped one
does — defaulted to `Relation.new(self)`, so a direct `Model.x` call is
unchanged.

**What it costs.** The parameter is only READ when the body's own shape
says it should be: a constructor merges `__rel.scope_attributes`, a
query at implicit self roots on `__rel`. A body that does neither —
campfire's `find_by_transfer_id`, which is `find_signed(id, purpose:
:transfer)` — takes the relation and ignores it, so its lookup runs
against the whole table. An inactive user found by a valid transfer id
comes back here where Rails would answer nil.

The classification is made at SURVEY time, before `find_signed` has been
lowered to the `find_by` it becomes, which is why this one reads as
indifferent. Recognizing the sugar earlier would close it.

### `send_file` reads the whole file, and only the options it names

Rails STREAMS the file at `path`; `lower::send_file` grounds the call to
`send_data File.binread(path)` — the whole file in memory, because this
controller IS its own buffered response and its body is a String, so
there is no handle to pass down. Every corpus call site sends an image
measured in kilobytes.

The read is at the CALL SITE rather than in `runtime/ruby/`, and that is
deliberate: the shared runtime does no file I/O anywhere, because every
file under it transpiles to every target. See the pass's own header.

**What it costs.** `:filename`, `:status`, `:url_based_filename`,
`:stream` and `:buffer_size` are not reproduced, and a call carrying one
is LEFT ALONE rather than silently stripped — it fails by name, which is
a ledger entry rather than a response quietly missing a header. A
missing path raises `Errno::ENOENT` from the read where Rails raises
`ActionController::MissingFile`.

### `Attached::One#destroy` purges the blob too

Rails' `attached.destroy` falls through to the ATTACHMENT record, whose
destroy removes the join row and leaves the blob to a `purge_later` job.
There is no job here and an orphaned blob row would make `attached?`
answer for a file no longer attached, so `destroy` is `purge` — the same
reasoning `attach`'s replace-first already carries.

### An account logo is a real variant; the test that measures it sees both states

`Current.account&.logo_variant(size)` is `logo.variant(:large)
.processed` / `(:small)`, and campfire's logo endpoint `send_file`s the
variant record's image blob — a 512×512 or 192×192 PNG made by the
processor (see "Active Storage: rows and bytes are modeled, variants
are a seam"). Worth keeping in the ledger because of how it MEASURES:
campfire's own tests decode the response and assert the dimensions.
They first passed on the stock-icon fallback (exactly those sizes)
while a custom logo was never served at all; then, with uploads landed
and variants identity, they failed on the real divergence (the bytes
were the upload); now they pass on the variant's bytes. A dimension
assertion could not see the first gap; it saw the second, and it is
what says the third state is the right one.

### A rich text materialized by a READ is not written through

`message.body` answers an `ActionText::RichText` whether or not a row
exists — that is what makes `body.to_plain_text` safe on a message with
none. Rails AUTOSAVES that built record, putting an empty row in the
table for a message nobody ever gave a body; here the autosave skips a
record that is still unsaved AND still blank.

**Why the difference shows up here and not in Rails.** Rails' fixture
loader inserts rows with raw SQL and runs no callbacks, so a `Message`
never reads its own `body` during a load. Ours loads THROUGH the model,
so campfire's search-index callback read `body`, the read materialized
an empty rich text, and `after_save` claimed the
`(record_type, record_id, name)` unique key — before the rich-text
fixture, whose thirteen records are every message's actual text, could
insert its own row.

**What it costs.** An app that reads `record.<rich_text>` and then saves,
without ever assigning, gets no row where Rails would leave a blank one.
Nothing can observe the difference through the reader (both answer a
blank content); a direct query for the row can.

### `destroy!` cannot fail

Rails raises `RecordNotDestroyed` when a `before_destroy` callback
throws `:abort`. `destroy!` here is `destroy`.

**Why.** This runtime has no abort channel: `before_destroy` returns
into the void and `destroy` always completes. The bang form is kept as
its own method so the raise has a home when the channel exists, rather
than aliasing the two names together.

**What it costs.** Nothing today — no corpus app halts a destroy from a
callback. An app that did would see the row deleted where Rails would
have raised.

### A recast row is a NEW OBJECT sharing the old row's id

`record.becomes!(Rooms::Open)` in Rails hands the sibling the SAME
attribute hash, so writes through either object are visible in both.
Here (`src/lower/sti_scope.rs`, which unrolls the copy column by
column into the synthesized `becomes_from`) the sibling gets a COPY.

**Why.** Shared mutable attribute state across two objects is the shape
the typed targets have no representation for — each carries its columns
as its own typed slots, not as a hash one can hand around.

**What it costs.** Code that keeps the pre-recast object and writes
through it loses those writes. The Rails idiom reassigns
(`@room = @room.becomes!(Rooms::Closed)`), which is what campfire's two
sites do; a site that kept both handles would diverge silently.

### `errors[:field]` re-derives its field from the message text

Rails' error accumulator keeps an attribute alongside every message, so
`errors[:url]` is an exact lookup. Here the accumulator is a plain
`Array[String]` of FULL messages (`"Url is not public"`), and
`src/lower/errors_index.rs` grounds the read as
`ActiveSupport.errors_for(errors, "Url ")` — a prefix match against the
humanized field name that `errors.add` / `validates` baked at lower
time.

**Why.** Adding an attribute column changes `@errors`' type in every
strict target — `Vec<String>` becomes a vector of pairs, and every
emitted `validate` body, every `errors <<`, and the `full_messages`
identity fold move with it. The projection is recoverable from the text
the runtime already stores, so the type stays.

**What it costs.** Two cases, both named rather than silent:

- One field's humanized name being a PREFIX of another's — `url` and
  `url_host` humanize to `"Url"` and `"Url host"` — makes
  `errors[:url]` also answer `"Url host can't be blank"`, with the
  wrong prefix stripped. No corpus app has such a pair; an app that did
  would diverge silently, and that is the case that would force the
  attribute column.
- `errors[:base]` DECLINES. Rails attaches `:base` messages to the
  record, so `errors_add` bakes them with no prefix and there is no
  text to match. Those sites stay dynamic and join the
  `errors_index` residue ledger.

### A Turbo stream name is not signed — CLOSED on the ruby family

**CLOSED 2026-09-22 on the ruby family (spinel + CRuby overlay).**
`Turbo::Streams::StreamName.signed` / `.verified`
(`runtime/spinel/turbo_streams.rb`) are turbo-rails' verifier
reproduced: `ActiveSupport::MessageVerifier.new(key, digest: "SHA256",
serializer: JSON)` with the key derived from `secret_key_base` under
the gem's own salt (`turbo/signed_stream_verifier_key`), and no
`_rails` metadata envelope because turbo signs with no purpose and no
expiry. The bytes are pinned against campfire's Rails —
`runtime/spinel/test/turbo_streams_test.rb` holds two names Rails
minted for a known secret — so a name this runtime writes verifies
under Rails and a name Rails signed verifies here.

**Both ends in one file.** `ActionView::ViewHelpers.turbo_stream_from`
spells the attribute through `ViewHelpers.signed_stream_name`, which
`turbo_streams.rb` reopens for this family to write the signed name;
`verified` is the reader a subscribe reaches through the channel it
named. A spelled name, a tampered digest, a name signed under another
secret, and the old `--unsigned` encoding are all refused before any
channel's guard runs (`tests/overlay_cable_dispatch.rb`). The
`decode_stream_name` this section used to name as a third end was
removed by channel dispatch (below).

**What is still open — the strict targets.** The shared
`runtime/ruby/action_view/view_helpers.rb` writes
`signed-stream-name="<base64-of-JSON>--unsigned"` for the targets
that have no `MessageVerifier` (rust, go, typescript, python, crystal,
kotlin, swift, csharp, elixir — none carries `message_verifier.rb`),
and their cable glue, where it exists, ignores the suffix. On those
lanes a client can still subscribe to any stream it can spell. Signing
there is a per-target port of PBKDF2 + HMAC-SHA256, and it should
arrive with the rest of the verifier (signed cookies, signed ids), not
alone.

### A cable subscribe is not authorized on the SPINEL lane — CLOSED

**CLOSED 2026-08-30 on BOTH lanes.** `Cable.subscribe`
(`runtime/spinel/cable.rb`) now reads the `channel` the identifier
names, builds it through the generated `ActionCable::Channel.build`
(`project::apply_cable_channels` — one eager arm per class descending
from `ActionCable::Channel::Base`, found by transitive descent, plus
`Turbo::StreamsChannel`), runs the app's own `subscribed`, and
registers only the streams that method asked for. A `reject` — or a
channel name nothing defined, or a raise inside `subscribed` — sends
`reject_subscription` and registers nothing.

That puts campfire's `RoomStreamsAreAuthorized` in the lookup chain on
the spinel binary: `scripts/campfire-cable-drive.rb` against the
binary now reports *"the stock channel refuses the room's `:messages`
stream"*, which is the probe this entry existed for.

The rest of the entry is kept as the record of what the gap WAS, since
the shape recurs: identity without dispatch does not authorize
anything by itself.

The two runtimes had parted company here, and the description of each
follows.

- **CRuby overlay — CLOSED.** `Cable::Connection#handle_message`
  (`runtime/spinel/scaffold/ruby_overlay/cable.rb`) reads the `channel`
  the identifier names, resolves it through
  `ActionCable::Channel::Base::REGISTRY`, and runs the app's own
  `subscribed` on a worker thread holding a database handle. Only what
  that method asked for through `stream_from`/`stream_for` is
  registered, and a `reject` registers nothing. `current_user` comes off
  the identity `Cable.identify` resolved from the handshake.
- **spinel — HALF CLOSED, and the half that remains is the one that
  costs.** The HANDSHAKE is now identified: `Cable.identify`
  (`runtime/spinel/cable.rb`) builds the app's own
  `ApplicationCable::Connection` against an
  `ActionController::CookieJar` over the handshake's `req.cookies`, runs
  its `connect`, and answers a `reject_unauthorized_connection` with
  **401 before `res.start_websocket`** rather than an anonymous socket.
  The identified connection is carried on the per-upgrade
  `Cable::WsMessage` handler, which the driver holds, so it lives
  exactly as long as the connection. The class is reached through a
  generated eager arm (`project::apply_cable_connection`), not
  `const_get` — an app with no `app/channels/` keeps the default arm and
  connects anonymously, because Turbo fan-out predates identity.
  **SUBSCRIBE is still unrouted:** `Cable.handle_message` reads
  `identifier["signed_stream_name"]`, decodes it, and calls
  `Tep::Broadcast.subscribe_ws(stream, ws.fd)` without instantiating a
  channel, so no `subscribed` runs and the `current_user` that now
  EXISTS on the connection is never consulted. **A client that can spell
  a stream name still receives that stream's fan-out** — identity
  without dispatch does not authorize anything by itself.

**Why the split.** The two lanes share `runtime/spinel/turbo_streams.rb`
and the channel classes, but not the transport: the overlay rides Puma's
rack-hijack plus a nio4r reactor, spinel rides its own server, a green
thread per connection (`Tep::Server::Threaded`). Dispatch was built on
the overlay first on purpose — if the
frames do not match between Rails and the Ruby emit they were never
going to match on spinel, and that is far cheaper to find while
debugging one runtime instead of two (rubys/roundhouse#71).

**What it costs on spinel.** The path implemented is precisely the path
an app's channel guard exists to close. campfire prepends
`RoomStreamsAreAuthorized` onto `Turbo::StreamsChannel`:

```ruby
def subscribed
  if RoomMessagesChannel.guarded_stream?(verified_stream_name_from_params)
    reject                 # ...so the stock channel isn't a way around
```

and its comment states the reason — "authorizing room messages only in
`RoomMessagesChannel` would leave the stock channel as a way around it:
same signed stream name, no membership check." On spinel that prepend is
now EMITTED (the constant exists) and still never reached, because
nothing routes a subscribe frame to a channel.

**The prepend is now IN THE SPINEL BINARY'S LOOKUP CHAIN**, where it used
to be a commented-out line in `boot.rb`: spinel refused
`X.prepend Y` through an explicit receiver, and the class-reopen form its
own diagnostic recommended compiled and did nothing. Fixed upstream in
matz/spinel `a7b6f726`, so `apply_module_mixins` emits the reopen for
that target rather than a comment. It changes no behaviour YET, and that
is the point of saying so here: the guard is installed and unreachable,
because `handle_message` still never builds a channel to run
`subscribed` on. Identity does not move this either — `connect` running
gives the guard a user to test against, and the guard is still not in any
path.

The name is not a secret either: it is a GlobalID
(`GlobalID::Locator.locate gid_param, only: Room`), an identifier rather
than a capability. That is literally true of the names this runtime
mints: a record streamable contributes `GlobalID.param("Room", id)` —
`Base64.urlsafe_encode64` of `gid://<app>/Room/<id>`, no padding — which
is byte-identical to what `to_gid_param` produces in a real Rails
process. It is spelled that way so the app's own channel code can read
it back, the same rule the `/cable` handshake follows by running the
app's `connect`.

**Not a mitigation, but bounds on the blast radius:** fan-out is
in-process and single-worker, and the only frames published are those an
`after_commit` hook records. A subscriber learns nothing about streams no
hook writes to.

**This is not fixed by signing.** Signing decides whether the name was
tampered with; authorization decides whether the named stream may be
joined. campfire's own channel comment makes the point — Turbo's stock
channel "verifies only the signature on the stream name. That name
carries no expiry and no binding to a user." Both ends of that need
closing; **neither lane signs**, and that half is the entry below.

### An open socket outlives the authorization that opened it

`ActionCable.server.remote_connections.where(current_user: user)
.disconnect(reconnect: true)` — campfire's `User#deactivate` and
`#reset_remote_connections` — selects an empty set and returns.

**Why.** Nothing indexes live connections by user. `Cable::Reactor`'s
table is keyed by socket, and the identity a connection carries is read
off it rather than looked up by it. Closing the gap means an index the
reactor maintains on attach and drops on close, plus a posted close per
hit.

**What it costs.** Membership is checked at SUBSCRIBE time, which is
exactly the window campfire's `RoomMessagesChannel` comment calls out:
"revoking a membership disconnects the user with `reconnect: true`, and
the client then replays its subscriptions on the fresh socket." The
replay is now authorized on the CRuby lane — a revoked member's
resubscribe is refused. The disconnect that would FORCE that replay is
what does not happen, so an already-open socket keeps delivering to a
user whose membership was just revoked, until they reconnect for some
other reason.

### Rich text renders EMPTY on a target with no safe-list sanitizer

campfire's message presentation ends in `ContentFilters::SanitizeAttributes`,
which calls `ActionText::ContentHelper.sanitizer.sanitize(html, tags:,
attributes:)`. That reaches `ActionView::ViewHelpers.sanitize_allowing`,
which on the ruby family is the real `rails-html-sanitizer` and on every
other target raises `NotImplementedError` for input containing markup —
the same limit `sanitize` above already carries, for the same reason: the
allow-list is a rule table, and both ways to fake it are wrong in a way
nobody would see.

**What it costs.** campfire wraps its filter chain in its own `rescue
Exception` and returns `""`, so on those targets a message body renders
EMPTY: the record has the text, the database has the text, the page
returns 200, and `<div id="presentation_message_N">` is blank. Nothing is
logged either — the app's own log line runs through a no-op
`Rails.logger`.

**Where it bites.** The spinel campfire binary. The ruby lane is correct:
`scripts/campfire-cable-walk` asserts the posted body arrives in the
broadcast frame, and the room page carries it too.

**How it was found, which is the part worth keeping.** Not here — behind
it. An inherited class-side `new` was binding to the LEXICAL class, so
`ContentFilters::*.apply` built the abstract `ActionText::Content::Filter`
and `applicable?` raised `NotImplementedError`, which the same `rescue
Exception` turned into the same `""`. Every lane rendered empty bodies,
under a green 255/288 suite, until a live `GET /rooms/1`. That one is
fixed (`lower::class_body_new` monomorphizes the method into each
descendant); this is what was standing behind it.

**The fix is the sanitizer**, not this seam: port the safe-list rule
table (42 tags, 13 attributes, per-attribute URL protocols, CSS
behaviour) the way the inflector tables were ported, rather than deriving
one.

### A plain has_many reader answers an Array, not a Relation

`Room#memberships` (`has_many :memberships`) lowers to a reader that runs
the query and hydrates: it answers `Array[Membership]`. `Room#users`
(`has_many :users, through: :memberships`) lowers to an
`ActiveRecord::Relation` over a joins chain. Both are spelled
`owner.name`, and only the second answers the Relation API.

**What still costs.** Every Relation terminal but `pluck` — `count`,
`exists?`, `ids`, `where` — is a `NoMethodError` on a plain has_many
reader, as is any scope (`room.users.without(x)` works only because
`users` is a `:through`). `pluck` is closed, and closed narrowly:
`lower::assoc_pluck` expands `room.memberships.pluck(:user_id)` into
`room.memberships.map { |__pluck| __pluck.user_id }`, which is the
projection it is. That was a 500 on every `POST /rooms/:id/messages` in
a served app — the broadcast still went out, because `after_create_commit`
runs before the line, so the message reached subscribers and the request
that made it then failed. The suite never saw it: under the test adapter
the job that reaches the line is enqueued rather than run.

**What the projection costs.** The reader hydrates every row, which is
what it ALREADY does — the projection is the only new work. Rails reads
one column. So this is a fix for the crash, not for the query.

**What would close the rest** is the association proxy: an association
reader that IS a chain root, so `room.memberships.pluck(:user_id)` folds
to `SELECT user_id FROM memberships WHERE room_id = ?` and every other
terminal follows. That is designed and not built. `lower::assoc_pluck`
is deliberately not a down payment on it — a half-built chain root that
handles one terminal is worse than none, because the next terminal to
arrive looks supported until it is not.

**A note on what the type says.** `Ty::Array` does NOT distinguish the
two: the analyzer types a `:through` reader `Array[Room]` as well, its
approximation of "a collection". The association KIND is what determines
which reader gets emitted, and it is what the pass reads.

### `config.x.<key> = <expr>` is re-evaluated on every read

`config.x.web_push_pool = WebPush::Pool.new(...)` in an initializer is an
ASSIGNMENT: Rails evaluates the right-hand side once at boot and every
`Rails.configuration.x.web_push_pool` reads that one object. Ingest lifts
it to a reader on the Application reopen:

```ruby
def x_web_push_pool
  WebPush::Pool.new(invalid_subscription_handler: ->(id) { ... })
end
```

which re-runs the expression on every read.

**What it costs.** For a literal (`config.x.vapid.public_key = "…"`, the
common case) nothing at all. For a constructor it is a new object per
read, and campfire's is the bad kind: `WebPush::Pool.new` builds a
50-thread executor, a 1-thread pool and a 150-connection HTTP pool, and
the `shutdown` the app's `at_exit` calls reaches only the last one. One
per message created.

**Not the reason campfire's push path fails today** — that is
`uninitialized constant Net::HTTP::Persistent`, which the pool's
constructor hits first. Memoizing the reader would not fix that; it is a
separate entry because it would still be wrong once the constant exists.

### An initializer's `prepend` is not performed on the spinel target

`config/initializers/turbo_streams_authorization.rb` — campfire's
`Turbo::StreamsChannel.prepend RoomStreamsAreAuthorized` — is emitted as
a live line at the end of the ruby family's `boot.rb` and as a COMMENT in
the spinel tree's.

**Why.** Spinel refuses the explicit-receiver form outright: "the class
graph, ancestor chain, and method/ivar layout are baked at compile time,
so a class cannot be restructured through an explicit receiver." Its
diagnostic recommends moving the call inside a `class X ... end` reopen,
and **that form compiles and does nothing** — a prepended `hello` calling
`super` prints `guarded hi` under CRuby and `hi` from the binary, with no
warning. Emitting it would put the guard back in the tree, tested, and
out of the lookup chain, which is the failure `lower::module_mixins`
exists to prevent, minus the report. Filed as matz/spinel#4200.

A `prepend` inside the class's ORIGINAL body works on spinel; only a
reopen is silent. That is no help here — the target class is turbo-rails'.

**What it costs today: nothing, and that is a fact about a second gap
rather than a defence.** The spinel lane does not dispatch a subscribe
frame to a channel at all (see above), so `Turbo::StreamsChannel
#subscribed` never runs and a guard prepended onto it would not run
either. The two have to close in that order.

**Where it is visible.** The emitted `boot.rb` carries the commented
line and the reason, so the absence names itself in the file someone
would read.

### A cable stream name is not signed, on either lane — CLOSED

**CLOSED 2026-09-22.** See "A Turbo stream name is not signed" above:
the ruby family signs and verifies with Rails' bytes, and the channel
guard (`RoomStreamsAreAuthorized`) now stands BEHIND a signature check
rather than instead of one. What remains is the strict targets' half,
recorded there.

### The logger stack exists; `Rails.logger` does not use it yet

`runtime/ruby/logger.rb` is Ruby's `Logger::Formatter` plus
`ActiveSupport::Logger` and `TaggedLogging` — the stack a Rails app's
`config.logger =` builds, and the parent campfire's
`LogScrubbingFormatter` subclasses so a bot key in a request path
(`/rooms/1/5-Ab3xK9mQz1Rt/messages`) is redacted before the line is
written. It renders Ruby's own line format, pinned against bytes ruby
minted (`runtime/ruby/test/logger_test.rb`).

**What is not wired.** `Rails.logger` still answers the small
stderr-prefixing `Rails::Logger` in `runtime/ruby/rails.rb`, and
`config.logger = …` in an app's `production.rb` is not lifted at
ingest. So an emitted binary's own log lines (`Rails.logger.error "…"`,
eight sites in campfire) are neither formatted by this stack nor passed
through the app's formatter.

**What that costs today: nothing measurable, and the reason matters.**
The formatter exists to scrub REQUEST log lines, and this runtime
writes none — there is no `ActionDispatch` request-logging middleware,
so the path that would carry a bot key is never logged in the first
place. The exposure appears the day request logging does, which is why
the two belong in one commit: a request log wired up without
`config.logger` lifted would write bot keys verbatim, and that is the
failure that looks like a feature.

### `Tempfile.create` opens by name, not `O_EXCL`

`runtime/ruby/tempfile.rb` is the block form of Ruby's `Tempfile.create`
for the targets with no stdlib to bind to — the ipaddr/zlib
arrangement, and the CRuby and JRuby trees take Ruby's own. The name is
the temp dir, a prefix, the pid and 64 bits from `SecureRandom`.

**What differs.** Ruby's `create` opens with `O_EXCL` and retries on a
collision, so it cannot be made to clobber a file an attacker
pre-created in the temp directory. This opens the computed path with
`File.open(path, "wb+")`, so a pre-created file at that exact path
would be written to rather than refused.

**What it costs today: nothing, and why that is not the same as safe.**
Every caller in the corpus is a TEST writing probe bytes to its own
`TMPDIR`, and the name carries 64 random bits, so guessing it is not a
practical attack. The difference matters the day a RUNTIME caller
handles untrusted input through a temp file — at which point the
exclusive open is the fix, not a wider random component.

### `strip_tags` leaves entity references alone

`ActionView::ViewHelpers.strip_tags` parses the HTML and serializes the
text, matching `Rails::HTML5::FullSanitizer` on 24 of 25 measured
probes — including the ones a regex gets wrong (`"a < b"` →
`"a &lt; b"`, a `>` inside a quoted attribute value, an unterminated
tag swallowing the rest, the CONTENT of a `<script>` surviving).

**Why.** The 25th is decoding: Rails turns `&eacute;` into `é`, which
needs HTML5's 2231-entry named-entity table. A well-formed reference
(`&name;`, `&#123;`, `&#xAB;`) passes through unchanged here instead,
and a bare `&` still escapes to `&amp;`.

**What it costs.** Nothing that renders: the two agree byte for byte on
every reference that round-trips (`&amp;`, `&lt;`, `&nbsp;`) and a
browser draws `&eacute;` and `é` the same. They part company only on
malformed input, where HTML5's legacy no-semicolon matching applies —
`&notanentity;` is `¬anentity;` to Rails and unchanged here.

`sanitize` is a separate matter and is NOT a divergence: the safe-list
sanitizer is unimplemented and raises on input containing markup,
serving only the tagless case that `sanitize(strip_tags(x))` produces.
That is a gap, and it names itself when reached.

### `strip_tags` drops `<script>` TEXT on JRuby and keeps it on CRuby

`ActionView::ViewHelpers.strip_tags("<b>Hi</b> &amp; <script>bad()
</script>there")` is `"Hi &amp; bad()there"` on the CRuby tree and
`"Hi &amp; there"` on the JRuby one. Same for `<style>`.

**Why.** Both trees serve `strip_tags` from the real
`rails-html-sanitizer`, and the gem's `best_supported_vendor` answers
`Rails::HTML5::Sanitizer` only where `Loofah.html5_support?` — which
needs an HTML5 parser in Nokogiri, and JRuby has none. So JRuby gets
`Rails::HTML4::Sanitizer`, whose full sanitizer removes the CONTENT of
`script` and `style` where the HTML5 one removes only the tags.

**Where it is visible.** This one probe and its `<style>` twin. Every
other sanitize / strip_tags / auto_link behaviour in the corpus was
checked against both vendors side by side and agrees, so the divergence
is exactly "the text inside a script or style element". It is Rails'
own difference, not ours: a Rails app on JRuby answers the same way.

**Where it is pinned.** `tests/overlay_sanitize_autolink.rb` asserts
BOTH values, branching on the vendor, so a runner whose nokogiri lacks
HTML5 reads as the other correct answer rather than as a regression.

### `auto_link` does NOT sanitize the body; Rails does — CLOSED

`ActionView::ViewHelpers.auto_link` now runs the safe-list pass before
linking, through the shared `sanitize` engine, with `sanitize: false`
skipping it as the gem's flag does. The entry below is kept as the
record of what the skip cost while it stood.


`ActionView::ViewHelpers.auto_link` on every target except the CRuby
overlay's finds and wraps the links exactly as `rails_autolink` does,
and hands back the body around them AS GIVEN. Rails runs the body
through the safe-list sanitizer first.

```text
input   a < b > c
Rails   a &lt; b &gt; c
here    a < b > c

input   addr <foo@bar.com> ok
Rails   addr  ok                      (the unknown tag is dropped)
here    addr <<a href="mailto:foo@bar.com">foo@bar.com</a>> ok

input   <a href='x'>t</a>
Rails   <a href="x">t</a>             (attributes renormalised)
here    <a href='x'>t</a>
```

**Why.** The safe-list pass is HTML5 tree construction, not filtering —
the argument is in the header of
`ruby_overlay/runtime/action_view_sanitize.rb` and is the same reason
the shared `sanitize` REFUSES markup instead of approximating it. That
refusal is the honest answer where the caller can be told; `auto_link`
is on campfire's read path, under a `rescue Exception` that returns
`""`, so raising there is a blank message body rather than an error.
Linking without the pass is the only remaining option, and it is stated
here rather than discovered.

**The size of it, measured.** Against `rails_autolink` 1.1.8 on
`actionview` 8.1.3, over 36 probes:

* **36 / 36** byte-identical to `auto_link(..., :sanitize => false)` —
  the gem minus this pass. Every linking decision is the gem's: the
  scheme list, where a URL ends, which trailing punctuation is the
  sentence's, the bracket rule, the e-mail local part, and both clauses
  of `auto_linked?`.
* **30 / 36** identical to the gem's default. All six differences are
  the three shapes above — escaped angle brackets, a dropped tag,
  renormalised quotes. Not one is a different link.

**What it costs, and what it does not.** The links this helper CREATES
are still safe by the gem's own rule table: the scheme list has no
`javascript:` in it and the `www.` branch is prefixed `http://`, so
`auto_link` cannot manufacture a scripting URL out of text. What is
lost is Rails' SECOND layer over markup that was ALREADY in the body.
campfire's is ActionText content that arrived through `h`, so the first
layer is the one doing the work — but an app that feeds `auto_link` raw
user HTML and leans on this pass to clean it gets no cleaning here.

One consequence follows from the same skip: Rails' body pass turns a
bare `&` into `&amp;` before the URL regex ever runs, so the gem's href
never carries one. Here it does — `https://x.co/a?b=1&c=2` reaches the
attribute as written. campfire's body arrives through `h`, so its `&`
is already an entity.

**A second, unrelated to sanitizing.** The gem strips trailing
`\p{Word}` — Unicode letters, marks, numbers and connector punctuation.
The port spells ASCII out and TAKES everything above it as a word
character. A URL ending in a non-ASCII letter agrees; one ending in
non-ASCII PUNCTUATION (`»`, `。`) keeps the character here and drops it
there.

**Where it is pinned.** `tests/shared_autolink.rb`, which asserts the
30 agreements AND the three divergent shapes, so a future change that
starts sanitizing says so in that file rather than in the campfire
suite. The CRuby overlay is unaffected: it redefines `auto_link` on the
real gem chain and is gated separately by
`tests/overlay_sanitize_autolink.rb`.

### `link_to` / `mail_to` put `href` FIRST; Rails puts it LAST

`ActionView::ViewHelpers.link_to("t", "/u", target: "_blank")` renders
`<a href="/u" target="_blank">`. Rails renders
`<a target="_blank" href="/u">` — measured against ActionView 8.2 for
both helpers, and `mail_to` and `link_to_raw` share the shape.

**Why.** Every one of these builds its attributes as
`{ href: href }.merge(opts.to_h)`, so the default lands ahead of the
caller's; Rails merges the other way round.

**Where it is visible.** ATTRIBUTE ORDER only — never in which
attributes, their values, or the element. `scripts/compare` is a DOM
comparison (see the note on its own output), so it cannot see this, and
the campfire tag tallies cannot either. It surfaced from the other
direction: the `auto_link` port in
`ruby_overlay/runtime/action_view_sanitize.rb` agrees with the real
`rails_autolink` gem on 13 of 14 probes, and the fourteenth is an email
address, where the anchor goes through `mail_to` and comes back with its
attributes transposed.

**Why it is still here, and what it would cost.** The fix is one `merge`
reversed in three helpers. The blast radius is MEASURED, not assumed:
**20 call sites total** — 6 in the campfire emit, 14 in lobsters, and
ZERO in the blog, because the view walker inlines most anchors as
literal strings and only reaches these helpers when the URL or the
attributes are dynamic. Every one of the 20 passes attributes, so every
one moves.

That is small enough to do, and it was left undone only because it
arrived at the tail of a session that had already changed the escape
surface twice. Do it with the golden dumps regenerated in the same
commit, and check `compare-*` on every target rather than assuming a
DOM comparison cannot see it.

### A `_path` helper turns `host:` into a query parameter

`RouteHelpers.room_at_message_path(1, 5, host: "once.campfire.test")`
emits `/rooms/1/@5?host=once.campfire.test`. Rails emits `/rooms/1/@5`.

**Why.** `:host` is a URL-GENERATION option, not a route segment and not
a query parameter. actionpack 8.1.1,
`ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet`:

```ruby
RESERVED_OPTIONS = [:host, :protocol, :port, :subdomain, :domain,
                    :tld_length, :trailing_slash, :anchor, :params,
                    :only_path, :script_name, :original_script_name]
```

`path_for` passes that list as `reserved`, so none of those names reaches
the query string. A `_path` helper drops `:host` entirely (`full_url_for`
is the only consumer); `:anchor` becomes `#frag`; `:params` becomes the
query. Our synthesis knows none of this and treats every leftover kwarg
as a query parameter.

**What it costs.** campfire's
`MessagesControllerTest#test_creating_a_message_broadcasts_the_message_to_the_room`
builds the expected copy-link URL with
`room_at_message_path(@room.id, Message.last.id, host: "once.campfire.test")`
and compares it to the rendered `data-copy-to-clipboard-content-value`.
Both sides are ours, so they would agree if the view rendered the same
wrong URL — the test fails because only the TEST passes `host:`. A page
that renders one of these is serving a URL with a bogus query on it.

**The fix is a rule table, not a special case.** Port `RESERVED_OPTIONS`
and give the four that MEAN something (`anchor`, `params`,
`trailing_slash`, and `host`/`protocol`/`port` for the `_url` family)
their actual behaviour, rather than dropping `host` alone and leaving
`anchor:` to become `?anchor=`.

### `ActionView::RecordIdentifier` is ruby-family only

Rails defines `dom_id` on `ActionView::RecordIdentifier` and includes
that module into its helpers. This runtime defines it on
`ActionView::ViewHelpers` and offers `RecordIdentifier.dom_id` as a
delegate — but only on the ruby family, from
`ruby_overlay/runtime/action_view_record_identifier.rb`.

**Why not `runtime/ruby/`, beside the function it delegates to.** That
directory prices all nine targets, and the ones with no module system
flatten `ActionView`'s modules into a single namespace. Kotlin emitted
both `domId`s into one `ViewHelpers.kt` and refused to build —
"Conflicting overloads", then "Overload resolution ambiguity" at the
call site. A delegate is exactly the shape that cannot survive
flattening: same name, same arity, same namespace.

**What it costs.** A strict target that meets
`ActionView::RecordIdentifier` gets an uninitialized constant. Nothing
does — the one caller is an app test helper, and those run on the ruby
family. A target that needs it wants the module split, not this file
copied.

### `assert_select`'s block does not scope its nested assertions

Rails runs an `assert_select` block against the MATCHED ELEMENTS: a
nested `assert_select` inside searches only what the outer one selected.
Ours yields with no scoping, so a nested assertion searches the last
response body again.

**What it costs, and the direction is the bad one.** A nested assertion
can PASS against markup the outer selector never matched. campfire's
broadcast test is the shape: the outer `assert_select` is scoped to a
Nokogiri fragment built from the pubsub queue, and the assertions inside
it look at the POST response instead. Both happen to contain the
message, so the inner assertion is answering about the wrong document
and agreeing anyway.

**Not fixed here.** Scoping means the block's assertions run against a
node set rather than a body, which is a change to every `assert_select`
call site's plumbing rather than to this one method.

### `try` narrows to the classes that answer, and cannot see every one

`recv.try(:name)` is Rails' `respond_to?(name) && public_send(name, …)`
— a DEFINEDNESS guard. It used to be grounded at ingest to
`recv && recv.name`, the `&.` desugar, which is a NILNESS guard: the two
agree whenever the receiver either is nil or does respond, and diverge on
the one case between. That cost campfire's own
`MessagesControllerTest#test_creating_a_message_broadcasts_the_message_to_the_room`,
where `streamble.try(:to_gid_param) || streamble` over `[room, :messages]`
raised on the Symbol instead of taking the fallback.

`lower::try_guard` now asks the TREE which classes answer the name and
emits a narrowing over the fewest `is_a?` tests that cover them:

```ruby
(s.to_gid_param if s.is_a?(ApplicationRecord) ||
                   s.is_a?(Opengraph::Location) ||
                   s.is_a?(Opengraph::Metadata)) || s
```

`nil.is_a?(X)` is false, so the narrowing does everything the nil guard
did and answers nil — rather than raising — for the non-nil receiver
that does not respond.

**WHAT IT STILL CANNOT SEE, and this is the divergence that remains.**
The pass reads methods DECLARED in the tree plus the short list the
pipeline synthesizes on every model. It does not see:

* **runtime methods** — `to_param`, `strip`, `id`. A `try(:strip)`
  therefore keeps the nil guard, because folding to nil would be wrong
  for exactly the names the runtime supplies.
* **column accessors**, which are synthesized from the schema after this
  pass runs. lobsters' 31 `try` sites are all of this shape
  (`user.try(:username)`), so they keep the nil guard too — correct
  there, since the receiver is a nilable `User` that does define it, but
  correct by accident rather than by decision.

So the divergence is narrower than it was and has not gone: a non-nil
receiver that does not answer a RUNTIME-supplied or COLUMN-backed name
still raises where Rails answers nil. Closing it means giving the pass
the schema and the runtime surface, both of which exist and neither of
which is wired to it.

**The earlier proposal, and why this is not it.** This entry used to say:
fold to nil when analysis knows the receiver's type has no such method,
"leaving the untyped-receiver case as it is today". The untyped receiver
IS the failing case — campfire's site is a block parameter over a mixed
array — so that plan would have closed nothing. The defining set is
knowable where the receiver's type is not.

### A conditional as a boolean operand needs its parens

`lower::try_guard` emits `x.m if cond`, and a modifier-`if` binds looser
than every boolean operator. Rendered bare as the left operand of `||`,
`x.m if cond || fallback` re-parses with the fallback INSIDE the
condition — the expression answers nil and the fallback never runs. The
Ruby emitter parenthesizes an `If` / `Case` / `RescueModifier` operand
for that reason, the same call `recv_needs_parens` already made for a
receiver.

Worth knowing because it is invisible in review: the emitted line is
valid Ruby either way, and only the parse changes.

### Four of Rails' reserved URL options are still query params

`url_for` splits a route helper's option hash in two: the twelve names in
`ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet::RESERVED_OPTIONS` (actionpack 8.1.3,
`route_set.rb:838`) it consumes itself, and everything else, which it
forwards to the path generator and which ends up in the query string. We
forwarded all twelve, so `room_at_message_path(1, 5, host: "x")` rendered
`/rooms/1/@5?host=x` where Rails renders `/rooms/1/@5` — and that extra
`?host=` was what failed campfire's own broadcast assertion.

`lower::route_url_options` now models the split as a table, and the table
has three filled cells and one empty one:

* **the seven host-only names** — `host`, `protocol`, `port`,
  `subdomain`, `domain`, `tld_length`, `only_path` — are dropped from a
  `_path` call site. `path_for` is `url_for(…, PATH, …)`, and the `PATH`
  strategy never calls `build_host_url`, so these contribute nothing to
  a path. Dropping them is EXACT, not an approximation.

  On the `_url` spelling they are not dropped, because there they are
  the answer: `x_url(…, host: h)` becomes
  `"http://#{h}#{RouteHelpers.x_path(…)}"` — the same shape the view
  lowerer grounds a hostless `_url` with (`Rails.application.domain` in
  place of `h`) and the same one
  `emit::ruby::library::rewrite_url_helpers_absolute` builds for the
  explicit `…routes.url_helpers.x_url(…, host:)` chain. `protocol:`
  replaces the `http` and rides bare (`"https"`, not `"https://"`),
  which is that older pass's convention; Rails' `normalize_protocol`
  accepts both spellings and we accept only the first.
  `x_url(…, only_path: true)` is Rails asking the URL spelling for a
  path, and gets one.
* **`anchor:`** is rendered, `#tag`, after the query string — the order
  `path_for` applies `add_params` and then `add_anchor` in.
* **`format:`** is `lower::route_format_suffix`'s, which monomorphizes
  the helper rather than widening its signature.
* **`params:`** is the query itself — Rails merges its value into the
  generated query string, which is what an erased `**splat` renders
  too — so the two are one shape: `foo_path(…) + RouteHelpers.query_suffix(h)`,
  rendered at run time through `ActionView::ViewHelpers.to_query`. On
  the ruby family that is `Hash#to_query` in full (nested Hashes as
  `a[b]`, Arrays as `a[]`, pairs sorted per level, `runtime/spinel/hash_to_query.rb`),
  and `CgiIo.parse_form_into` reads the brackets back; every other
  family renders a value as its `to_s`, in insertion order.
* **`script_name:`, `original_script_name:` and `trailing_slash:` are
  NOT modeled.** Each genuinely changes the path — the first two prefix
  it, the third appends a `/` — and each is still treated as an
  ordinary query key, so `foo_path(trailing_slash: true)` renders
  `?trailing_slash=true`. Left visibly wrong rather than silently
  dropped: no corpus app writes one of them on an app route, and a
  dropped option is a URL that looks right and is not.

A second, smaller divergence in the same place: Rails escapes a fragment
with `Journey::Router::Utils.escape_fragment`, which leaves `/`, `?` and
`:` alone. The generated helper reuses the `url_encode` its query keys
use, which percent-encodes them. Every anchor the corpus writes is a
slug, a tag or a `dom_id`, so nothing can tell the difference today.

### An exception reported to Sentry reaches stderr, and loses its detail

`Sentry.capture_exception` is a façade in `runtime/ruby/gem_facades.rb`
that writes one line to stderr and returns nil. Nothing is transmitted
to an error-tracking service, because this runtime has none.

**It is the one façade in that file that does not raise**, and
deliberately: every other occupant stands in for a path the read side
never executes, so a loud raise is a useful alarm. `capture_exception`
is only ever called from a `rescue` — it runs on exactly the paths that
are already going wrong, and a raise there replaces the app's error
handling with a second error. campfire's `MessagesHelper.message_tag`
is the case: with no `Sentry` constant in the tree the rescue itself
raised `NameError`, and a rendering failure became a 500 for the whole
request, which is the opposite of what the handler was written for.

**The line carries no detail.** `exception.message` and
`exception.class` both fail inside the façade in the emitted campfire
tree (`undefined method 'message' for an instance of NoMethodError`) —
the parameter is declared `untyped` there and the dispatch table comes
out short, the same shape as matz/spinel#4219. Three reductions failed
to reproduce it standalone. An app's own logging is unaffected:
campfire's next line, `Rails.logger.error "… #{e.class} … #{e.message}"`,
runs, because its `e` is the rescue's own local.

Rails with the gem installed and no `SENTRY_DSN` also transmits
nothing, so the *delivery* half of this is not a divergence for an
unconfigured deployment; the lost detail is.

### `ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_attributes` answers the list, not `nil`

Rails declares it `mattr_accessor(:allowed_attributes)` with no default
(actiontext 8.1.3, `app/helpers/action_text/content_helper.rb:11`), so
in an app that never configured it the reader answers `nil` and every
caller falls through its own `||`. Ours answers the list that fallback
computes — the sanitizer's own set plus `ActionText::Attachment::
ATTRIBUTES`, which is exactly what Rails' `sanitizer_allowed_attributes`
builds from the same two pieces.

**Why, and it is a type problem rather than a behaviour one.** campfire's
`ContentFilters::SanitizeAttributes` copies Rails' expression verbatim:

```ruby
ActionText::ContentHelper.allowed_attributes ||
  (sanitizer_class.allowed_attributes + ActionText::Attachment::ATTRIBUTES).to_a
```

`sanitizer_class` is `ActionText::ContentHelper.sanitizer.class` — a
CLASS OBJECT. Neither we nor spinel can dispatch statically on one: our
`Ty` has no singleton variant (`analyze::body::send` collapses
`instance.class` onto the instance's own `Ty::Class`), and spinel's
`sp_Class` is a dynamic receiver. So the right arm is `Array[untyped]`
whatever the left says, and the result was handed twelve lines later to
a `sanitize` this runtime declares takes `Array[String]`. One list,
described two contradicting ways — and on spinel the contradiction
surfaced as far from its cause as it could get:

```
sanitize_attributes.rb:13: error: incompatible pointer types passing
  'sp_PolyArray *' to parameter of type 'sp_StrArray *'
```

from the C compiler, with the campfire binary failing to LINK.

Typing the LEFT arm closes it, because `||` now folds to a left that
cannot be falsy (Ruby's falsy set is `nil` and `false` and nothing else,
so it reads off the type) instead of unioning with the right. The values
are identical either way: campfire computes the same list from the same
two pieces. Only an app that asks whether the reader is `nil` can tell
the difference, and none does.

**What is still not modeled:** a method that returns a class object is
declared by its INSTANCE type, because that is the only type we have.
`def sanitizer_class: () -> Class` is what gets emitted — honest, and
what spinel's `sp_Class` wants — but a chain through it stays dynamic.
Closing that means a singleton variant in `Ty`, which every target's
exhaustive `match` would have to answer for.

### A model has no `to_param`, so every avatar URL 500s — FIXED

**FIXED 2026-08-31**, exactly as scoped below: `push_to_param_method`
synthesizes `@id.to_s` beside `dom_prefix`
(`model_to_library/markers.rs`), skipping abstract models and any model
carrying its own `to_param` (it runs after `push_user_methods` with a
skip guard, because that pass's dedup runs the other way — a
synthesized name pushed first would SHADOW the model's override, the
opposite of what the original wording here assumed). Behind the fixed
wall stood nothing: `Zlib.crc32` and the initials-SVG template both ran
first try, and the avatar answered 200 with the full SVG. The demo's
avatars are the initials arm — Active Storage only serves an avatar a
user UPLOADED, which the archive excludes anyway.

The browser then found the second half, below: 200 with
`text/html`, and browsers do NOT sniff SVG in an `<img>` — a correct
body rendered as a broken image. Both halves verified together:
`image/svg+xml` on the wire, `naturalWidth` 150 in Chromium, and the
e2e LEDGER entry in `helpers.js` retired so an avatar 500 FAILS the
suite now. The original entry follows.

Rails gives every `ActiveRecord::Base` a `to_param` (`id&.to_s`), which a
model may override — lobsters' `User#to_param` answers the username. The
lowered model gets no such method: `model_to_library` registers a
SIGNATURE for `persisted?` and friends (`mod.rs:1274`) but synthesizes no
`to_param` body, and the definition that exists lives in
`runtime/spinel/scaffold/ruby_overlay/runtime/active_support_core_ext.rb`
— the **ruby overlay**, which the spinel target never applies.

campfire calls it directly:

```ruby
# app/models/users/avatars_helper.rb:9
AVATAR_COLORS[Zlib.crc32(user.to_param) % AVATAR_COLORS.size]
```

so on the spinel binary every avatar request answers

```
500 GET /users/<sgid>/avatar -- NoMethodError: undefined method 'to_param' for an instance of User
```

**Measured 2026-08-30** against the campfire spinel binary with assets
built: four such 500s on the signed-in room page, reported by
`e2e/campfire/assets.spec.js`. Nothing else on the page fails — the
module graph, the stylesheets and the cable all load.

**Not caught by anything else, and that is the point.** The cable walk
(`scripts/campfire-cable-drive.rb`) never requests an avatar, the emitted
suite does not reach this helper, and the page returns 200 with the
avatar `<img>` simply broken. It took a browser asking for the file.

**The fix is a lowering, not a runtime file** — a `to_param` synthesized
beside `dom_prefix` (`model_to_library/markers.rs::push_dom_prefix_method`
is the template), pushed BEFORE `push_user_methods` so a model's own
override still wins. It is `id.to_s`, and it belongs to every target, not
to the ruby overlay.

Until then `e2e/campfire/helpers.js` carries it as a LEDGER entry so the
asset spec reports it without failing the run.

### A response body crossed the FFI as a C string — FIXED, and the "keep-alive serialization" diagnosis with it

**FIXED 2026-08-31.** The ~30 s second-browser stall this entry used to
attribute to a single worker parking in one connection's keep-alive loop
had a different cause entirely, and the correction matters because the
wrong version argued the demo needed `-w N` + Redis. It doesn't.

**What was actually wrong.** `Tep::Server::Scheduled#write_response`
wrote inline bodies with `sp_net_write_str` — a strlen-terminated C
string across the FFI — while announcing `Content-Length` from the same
string. A body with a NUL byte truncates at the NUL: `GET /account/logo`
(a PNG served through `res.body`; a PNG's 9th byte is 0x00) promised
405,666 bytes and delivered **8**. The sign-in page's `<img>` for that
logo therefore never finished; the browser held the request open waiting
for the difference, the page's load event hung, and only the server's
30 s `KEEPALIVE_TIMEOUT` closing the connection released it
(`net::ERR_CONTENT_LENGTH_MISMATCH`, then a retry that succeeded). The
"consistently ~30 s" signature was our own keep-alive timeout, observed
from the outside. Same family, same fix: `Content-Length` computed from
`length` (characters) understated the byte count of any page carrying
multibyte UTF-8, corrupting keep-alive framing, and the request-body
readers compared `raw_body.length` against a byte count. All wire
lengths are `bytesize` now and bodies go out through `write_bytes`
(both server variants, the request drains, and the raw-mode fan-out).

**What was wrong with the old diagnosis.** It quoted
`Tep::Server#worker_loop` — the blocking prefork server — but the
scaffold's `main.rb` has booted `Tep::Server::Scheduled`
(fiber-per-connection) since cable landed. That server never serialized
on keep-alive; idle-holder probes against it answer in single-digit
milliseconds. The stale-comment lesson again: the quoted code was real,
just not the code that runs.

**Verified**: `e2e/campfire` two-context sign-in went 30,422 ms →
**303 ms**; `/account/logo` delivers all 405,666 bytes and `file(1)`
parses the result as a complete PNG; `scripts/campfire-cable-walk
--spinel` 13/13; `scripts/compare spinel` 7/7.

**Why no existing gate saw it.** The walk and the suite never fetch a
binary body over the wire and byte-count it against the header;
`assets.spec.js` watches for 404s and console errors, and a truncated
200 is neither. It took a browser waiting on the missing bytes.

Still true and worth keeping from the old entry: `-w N` preforks
processes whose `Tep::Broadcast` registries are per-worker, so
cross-worker fan-out still needs the opt-in `Tep::RedisFeed`. That is a
scaling limit, not — as this entry used to claim — a prerequisite for
"two tabs, one room, one live message" on one worker.

### `send_file`'s content type is dropped on the tep lane — FIXED

**FIXED 2026-08-31.** The controller runtime was never the problem —
`render`/`send_file`/`send_data` all store `@content_type` — the
scaffold's dispatch glue forwarded it to the response only for the
`:json` and `:turbo_stream` request formats. Everything else fell to
tep's inline-body default (`text/html`): the account logo's
`image/png`, and — the case that made it urgent — the initials
avatar's `image/svg+xml`, because browsers do NOT sniff SVG in an
`<img>` and rendered a correct 200 as a broken image. The glue now
forwards ANY controller content type that differs from the html
default, which is the contract the CRuby overlay dispatch has always
had (`ruby_overlay/main.rb` passes it unconditionally). Verified:
logo `image/png`, avatar `image/svg+xml`, turbo-stream POSTs still
`text/vnd.turbo-stream.html`.

### A `tag.<el>` whose arguments are all keywords rendered its attributes as TEXT — FIXED

**FIXED 2026-08-31.** `tag.time **attributes, datetime: …, data: { … }`
rendered as

```html
<time>{datetime: "2026-08-31T00:38:06Z", data: {local_time_target: :date}}</time>
```

— the attribute hash stringified into the tag's BODY. `ingest::expr`
desugars a double splat into the `merge` chain it is defined to be, which
is a `Send` rather than a `Hash`; `tag_builder`'s content/attributes split
therefore read the sole argument as CONTENT. The guard meant to catch
this required `args.len() > 1`, and a call whose arguments are entirely
keywords has exactly one. Now:

```html
<time datetime="2026-08-31T00:45:43Z" data-local-time-target="date"></time>
```

Not campfire-specific: it hit every `tag.<el>` call with a `**splat` and
no positional content.

**A CORRECTION TO WHAT THIS ENTRY USED TO SAY.** It claimed the
broadcast-rendered row "carries no body", on the strength of a browser
observation. Measured directly over HTTP, the server render **does**
contain the body — `message__body` markup and the posted text are both
present, before and after this fix. The two render paths do not disagree:
what looked like a direct render in the browser was campfire's own
CLIENT-side optimistic echo (`app/views/messages/_template.rb`, the
`$messageDatetime$` template), which is why its element carried a
client-generated id. Why tab B's DOM did not display a body that is in
the HTML it received was unexplained here until 2026-08-31; the answer
is in the sanitizer entry below — the body was never in the frame for a
*Trix-composed* message, and every direct-over-HTTP measurement had
posted plain text, which takes the one path that works.

**A near-miss worth keeping.** The first version of the fix routed to the
`content_tag` fallback, which `return`s before the inline path's
`qualify_view_helpers` — so it emitted a bare `ViewHelpers.content_tag`.
The emitted tree defines only `ActionView::ViewHelpers`. On the SPINEL
binary that resolved and rendered correctly; on CRuby it raised
`NameError` inside `MessagesHelper#message_tag`, whose body campfire
wraps in `rescue Exception`, so every message became `""` and vanished.
The suite reported `expected "#message_13" in response body` — five
tests, two files, no mention of a constant. **The AOT target was the
PERMISSIVE lane here and the interpreted one caught it**, which inverts
the usual assumption. Qualification now happens inside
`content_tag_fallback`, so every fallback path is covered.


### An HTML message body renders as nothing: the safe-list sanitizer is a raising façade behind a `rescue Exception` — FIXED, twice over

**FIXED 2026-08-31, in two acts, verified in a browser** (e2e/campfire
4/4 including the two-tab live-message milestone; smoke floor raised
3 → 4 in the same commit).

**Act one: the safe-list sanitizer is PORTED, not raising.**
`ActionView::ViewHelpers.sanitize` / `sanitize_allowing` are now a real
scanner-based safe-list sanitizer in the shared runtime — the gem's own
rule tables (rails-html-sanitizer 1.7.1 / loofah 2.25.2: default tags
and attributes, URI attributes, the 27 allowed protocols, data-URI
mediatypes, and loofah's `allowed_uri?` decode-strip-downcase pipeline
step for step). MEASURED: byte-identical with the gem on 75 of 81
corpus probes (`tests/shared_sanitize.rb`); the six divergences are
declared policies, every one more-escaped or more-blocked than the gem,
never less:

* entities in text and in kept attribute values stay as written rather
  than being decoded and re-serialized (same policy `strip_tags`
  ledgers; identical rendering);
* no HTML5 tree reconstruction on malformed nesting — source tag order
  is kept, still-open tags close at end of input, a close nothing
  opened is dropped;
* a numeric reference to a C1 control in a URL (`jav&#x85;ascript:`) is
  decoded, stripped and therefore BLOCKED, where the gem's parser
  remaps it to its Windows-1252 character first and allows it.

The refusal that remains, narrowed to where it is honest: an allow-list
naming a rawtext/foreign/template container raises `NotImplementedError`.
No corpus caller does. The CRuby overlay keeps binding the real gem.

**An allowed `style` attribute is DROPPED, not served.** Its value wants
Loofah's CSS scrubber (`scrub_css` over the Crass tokenizer), which is
not ported; keeping it unscrubbed is the unsafe direction, so the port
leaves `style` out of the allow-list and removes it from every element,
where the gem keeps the declarations its CSS safe-list passes. This used
to raise, and nothing reached it until campfire's Lexxy merge (`9a258bd`):
the lexxy gem's engine adds `style` to Action Text's attribute list, and
the raise inside campfire's `rescue Exception` rendered EVERY message
body on the spinel binary as `""`. On CRuby (the gem) a message's inline
styles survive; on spinel they do not. Porting the CSS scrubber closes
this.

**Act two: `h()` must not escape the chain's product.** With the raise
gone, the body rendered as its own ESCAPED source: campfire's
`Filter.apply` wraps every filter product in
`ActionText::Content.new(...)`, whose `to_s` is born html-safe in Rails
— and neither lane carries that mark at runtime, so
`h(ContentFilters::TextMessagePresentationFilters.apply(...))` escaped
the sanitized markup on BOTH lanes (the overlay's gem sanitizer answers
a plain String too; invisible until now because every gate posted
plain text). The chain's type is not inferable (`*splat` of class
objects into a `reduce`), but its construction is statically visible,
so `lower::html_safe` now collects constants initialized
`ActionText::Content::Filters.new(...)` and rewrites
`h(<chain>.apply(x))` → `<chain>.apply(x).to_s` — the escape exemption
decided at the call-site rewrite layer, where every other exemption in
this runtime is decided, and one rewrite fixes both lanes.

The original entry follows, for the mechanism and the measurements.

### The original entry: what a browser found

A message posted in one browser tab reaches a second tab's DOM and is
inserted — and arrives EMPTY. The two render paths disagree about the
same message, in the same run.

**ROOT CAUSE FOUND 2026-08-31, and it is not the fan-out.**
`MessagesHelper#message_presentation` runs the body through
`ContentFilters::TextMessagePresentationFilters` and the sanitizer;
`ActionView::ViewHelpers.sanitize_allowing` is a deliberately RAISING
façade on this target ("the safe-list sanitizer is not modelled … only
tagless input is served"), and campfire wraps the whole helper in
`rescue Exception` → `Sentry.capture_exception` → `""`. So:

* a PLAIN-TEXT body (`message[body]=hello`) renders everywhere — page,
  frame, both tabs;
* an HTML body (`message[body]=<div>hello</div>`) renders as `""`
  everywhere — page AND frame.

**Trix always submits HTML.** Every message composed in the browser is
`<div>…</div>` at minimum, so every composer-posted message body
vanishes on every server-rendered path, while the DB row is correct
(`action_text_rich_texts.body` holds the full HTML). Tab A only ever
saw its own client-side echo. Every wire-level gate posts urlencoded
plain text (`campfire-cable-drive.rb`, the suite, curl probes), which
is why 13/13 walks and a green suite coexist with a chat app that
cannot display a chat message.

Two reporting gaps compounded it: `Rails.logger` is a no-op class in
`runtime/ruby/rails.rb`, so campfire's own `Rails.logger.error` line goes
nowhere, and the Sentry façade prints `details unavailable` (its `e`
arrives through an untyped parameter — see gem_facades.rb). Naming the
exception took splicing `$stderr.puts` into the emitted rescue.

**The fix is modelling the safe-list sanitizer for this target** (or
lowering campfire's filter chain onto the HTML infrastructure
`strip_tags` already uses). Until then this entry is what keeps
`cable.spec.js` at `test.fixme`.

**Measured 2026-08-30**, campfire spinel binary, two browser contexts,
one room. Tab A posts; both tabs are subscribed and `connected`:

| | body visible |
|---|---|
| tab A (direct render of its own POST) | **yes, +18 ms** |
| tab B (turbo-stream over `/cable`) | **no — 30 s, never** |

The frame does arrive. Tab B's `#messages_room_1` gains
`<div id="message_1" class="message …">` with the author, the avatar and
the "Message options" control. What it does not gain is the message text.

The same row also renders `local_time`'s options hash as TEXT rather
than expanding it into tag attributes — the two paths, same message:

```html
tab A: <time class="message__timestamp" datetime="2026-08-30T23:41:53.831Z"
             data-local-time-target="date" title="8/30/26, 7:41 PM">August 30, 2026</time>
tab B: <time>{datetime: "2026-08-30T23:41:53Z", data: {local_time_target: :date}}</time>
```

(An uppercased variant of that text appears in `innerText` because the
day separator carries `text-transform`; it is the same string.)

So the defect is in the partial as rendered by the BROADCAST path, not in
the fan-out: a helper whose keyword options survive one path and become a
stringified Hash on the other, and a body that is dropped entirely.

**Why the cable walk does not see it.**
`scripts/campfire-cable-drive.rb` asserts `html.include?(BODY)` against
the raw frame — it reads the wire, not the DOM, and never renders. This
is the same shape as [[project_campfire_empty_message_bodies]]'s lesson
("an emptiness test must not go through a renderer") arriving from the
opposite direction: a wire test cannot see a renderer that drops content
downstream of the bytes it checked.

Tracked by `e2e/campfire/cable.spec.js` — `test.fixme` while this was
open, an executing milestone spec (and a smoke-floor increment) since
it closed.
### A forwarded `**` bundle bound the OPTIONAL KEYWORD beside it — FIXED

**FIXED 2026-08-31.** The other half of the `<time>` defect above, and
the one the `tag_builder` fix could not reach. campfire writes

```ruby
def local_datetime_tag(datetime, style: :time, **attributes)   # time_helper
def message_timestamp(message, **attributes)                   # messages_helper
  local_datetime_tag message.created_at, **attributes
```

`ingest::library_class` flattens BOTH keyword forms to positionals —
`style:` to a positional-with-default, `**attributes` to a trailing
positional defaulting to `{}` — and `ingest::expr` erases the call's `**`
into the `merge` chain it is defined to be, which is likewise positional.
Each half is individually sound. Together they slid the bundle one slot
left:

```ruby
def self.local_datetime_tag(datetime, style = :time, attributes = {})
TimeHelper.local_datetime_tag(message.created_at, attributes)   # → style
```

so `style` bound the whole hash and `attributes` bound `{}`. Every
message permalink rendered

```html
<time datetime="…" data-local-time-target="{class: &quot;message__timestamp&quot;}">
```

— the `class` dropped and the `data` attribute carrying an inspected
Hash. Now `local_datetime_tag(message.created_at, :time, attributes)`.

**Why an argument in that slot can only be an erased `**`.** The same
inference `lower::kwsplat` makes from arity, made from position instead:
`style:` is a KEYWORD in the source, so Ruby offers no way to fill it
positionally, and a positional argument sitting there cannot have been
written by the app's author. It is ingest's own flattening showing
through. That reasoning needs a fact the flattening destroys, so ingest
now records it — `Param::from_keyword` and `Param::from_kwrest` mark the
two flattened shapes. Both are inert in emit (the emitted parameter list
is byte-identical) and read only by `lower::kwrest_forward`.

**The one thing that did NOT change is the emitted parameter list.** The
repair is entirely at the call site. Across all of campfire the pass
rewrites exactly one line, and raises no residue diagnostic.

**KNOWN DIVERGENCE.** A bundle that actually CARRIES one of the named
keywords — `message_timestamp(message, style: :date)` — keeps it in the
rest hash instead of binding the parameter, so the callee sees its
default and the key renders as a stray attribute. Ruby distributes by key
at call time; nothing static knows the keys of a hash forwarded through a
method boundary. The previous behaviour was wrong for EVERY bundle, this
one for the subset that names a keyword, and campfire's two call sites
are both outside that subset. A literal keyword list is unaffected —
`local_datetime_tag ts, style: :date` is `lower::helper_kwargs`' case and
still splices by name, which is why the two passes run in that order.

### Response headers differ from Rails in SHAPE — MEASURED (2026-09-28)

`scripts/campfire-http-shape` sends 71 requests (86 responses with
revisits) to Rails campfire and to the emit, on the same seed, and
compares status, Content-Type, Cache-Control, ETag, Vary,
Content-Encoding, Location, Set-Cookie names and attributes, and every
other header. Rails against itself: zero differences. Rails against the
emit: 86 of 86 responses differ on the ruby lane, 90 on spinel. The
sweep is basecamp/once-campfire-rust's, vendored; see the script's
header. Grouped by cause, largest first:

- **Rails' default security headers are absent** (54 responses):
  `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`,
  `Referrer-Policy`, `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`,
  `X-XSS-Protection: 0` — `config.action_dispatch.default_headers`,
  which every Rails response carries. Without `X-Frame-Options` any
  site can frame a signed-in campfire page. The one to close first.
- **The app's own `config.ru` middleware is not applied.** campfire's
  `config.ru` says `use Rack::Deflater`. The CRuby overlay now wraps
  `Main.run_rack` in `GzipCache` (Static stays outside so `/cable`
  hijack is never compressed; CSS/JS stay identity; identical HTML is
  not deflated on every request). spinel tep gzips inline bodies when
  `Accept-Encoding` includes gzip, from a cache keyed by SHA-256 of
  the identity body (CRuby keys by the body itself — MRI's string
  hash is cheaper than SHA-256 here). Gzip runs outside the lock on
  both lanes.
  Re-run `scripts/campfire-http-shape` before treating the 65
  Content-Encoding misses as current.
- **Rails' `Rack::ETag` / `Rack::ConditionalGet` are absent**: no weak
  ETag on a 200 (52), no `Cache-Control: max-age=0, private,
  must-revalidate`, so a revisit is 200 where Rails answers 304 (10-14).
  The explicit halves are the two entries above: "Conditional GET is
  ALWAYS FRESH", "`expires_in` records Cache-Control but emits no
  header" (the five asset/avatar/QR/blob/logo Cache-Control values).
- **Cookie attributes.** `session_token` is set without `expires`
  (campfire writes it `cookies.signed.permanent`, so a browser restart
  signs the user out) and without `SameSite=Lax`; the Rails session
  cookie likewise lacks both.
- **Formats.** A format the action does not render (`.xml`, `.yaml`,
  `Accept: text/html` on the web manifest) answers 200 or 500 where
  Rails answers 406; the Turbo-stream and SVG content types lack
  `charset=utf-8`; a missing template is a 500, not a 406.
- **Redirects are relative.** Rails' `redirect_to` writes an absolute
  `Location` (`http://host/rooms/1`); ours writes the path.
- **Routes the emit does not serve:** `/up` (`rails/health#show`) is a
  404 (500 on spinel); `HEAD` of a page is a 404 on both lanes.
- **The account user list's next page is a 500** on both lanes:
  `/account/users?page=2` asked for as a Turbo Stream (what the list's
  infinite scroll sends past 500 users) reaches a view whose
  `turbo_stream` helper is not lowered (`NameError` on ruby, `replace`
  on an untyped receiver on spinel).
- **Blob URLs were signed differently — FIXED.** Rails' `blob_id`
  purpose signs with SHA1 over URL-safe padded Base64
  (`…fQ==--<40 hex>`); ours signed with SHA256 over unpadded, so a blob
  URL minted by Rails (in a page, an email, a cache) did not verify on
  the emit, and vice versa. Byte-identical now; see the next entry.
- **A variant URL's variation key is ours.** Rails' representation URL
  carries the variation SIGNED under the same verifier (purpose
  `variation`); ours carries a readable `limit-1200x800-keep`. The blob
  half of the URL is Rails' now; a representation URL minted by Rails
  still does not resolve on the emit, and vice versa.
- Smaller: `Last-Modified` absent on the paginated messages (5),
  `X-Total-Count` absent on the autocompleter JSON (2),
  `Content-Disposition` absent on avatar and logo images (2).

Each group is a fix in `runtime/ruby/` or an entry here; the sweep
becomes a gate the way campfire-compare's room page did, once the list
is ledgered.

### Rails' signed-value contracts, held to Rails' vectors — MEASURED (2026-09-29)

`tests/rails_compat_vectors.rb` runs the runtime's own signing and
verifying code — the cookie jar's verifier, `ActiveRecord::SignedId`,
`ActionText::SignedGlobalId`, Active Storage's blob verifier,
`GlobalID.param`, tep's cookie codec — against
`tests/rails_compat/rails_compat.json`: 500-odd cases minted by Rails
inside campfire in production mode, with a fixed secret and a frozen
clock (once-campfire-rust's generator, vendored beside it; our oracle's
bundle regenerates every deterministic section byte for byte). The
table it prints, and the gaps in it:

| section | match | |
|---|---|---|
| key_generator | 6/6 | |
| cookie_escaping.parse | 7/7 | |
| cookie_escaping.write | 3/5 | tep writes `%20` for a space and escapes `*`; Rails writes `+` and leaves `*`. Both decode the same. |
| signed_cookies.verify | 26/35 | see below |
| signed_cookies.generate | 1/10 | the jar writes `"exp":null`: `cookies.signed.permanent` is not modeled, so a session_token has no expiry inside the signature (nor on the Set-Cookie — the header entry above). |
| signed_cookies.generate_envelope | 10/10 | given Rails' expiry, the envelope is Rails' |
| json_string | 20/20 | the runtime's JSON string codec against the JSON inside Rails' signed cookies, both ways |
| signed_ids.generate / verify | 14/14, 29/31 | |
| global_ids, sgids.generate | 4/4, 5/5 | |
| sgids.verify | 19/24 | |
| app_verifiers.blob_id / envelope / data | 8/8, 3/3, 7/7 | fixed with this entry: the blob verifier signed with signed-id's envelope |
| encrypted_cookies | 0/28 | not implemented |
| csrf | 0/208 | not implemented |
| passwords | 0/45 | not held |

**What Rails still accepts that the runtime rejects, or reads
differently.** Signed cookies: a signed empty value reads as absent (the `""`
sentinel); pre-5.2 cookies with no metadata, and metadata with no
purpose, are rejected where Rails accepts them; an Integer or object
value reads back as its JSON text (the jar is String-typed); a
Marshal-serialized or unparseable value reads as its raw text where
Rails answers nil. Signed ids: the legacy SHA1 fallback verifier
(`use_legacy_signed_id_verifier`) is not consulted, and a String id
reads back as an Integer. Signed GlobalIDs: the Marshal-era (Rails 7.0),
JSON-legacy and globalid < 1.0 envelopes are rejected — campfire's own
`lib/rails_ext` reads the first unverified for mentions, which is the
path the runtime follows (`SignedGlobalId` unverified read), so a
mention renders; any other attachable signed by an older install does
not.

**Not implemented.** The session cookie is SIGNED where Rails'
`CookieStore` ENCRYPTS it (AES-256-GCM under
`"authenticated encrypted cookie"`), so a Rails `_campfire_session` is
not read after a migration — the flash and the CSRF secret start over,
while the user stays signed in (the `session_token` cookie is signed and
verifies). CSRF tokens are the session's own, unmasked (see
`runtime/spinel/request_forgery_protection.rb`'s header), so a form
rendered by Rails does not post to the emit. Passwords: the ruby family
runs the bcrypt gem; spinel's package is not yet held to these vectors.

**The JSON string codec — FIXED.** `MessageVerifier.json_string` was
quote-wrapping and `json_value` quote-stripping, so a value Rails signed
with a `<`, a quote or a newline in it read back as `\u003c` / `\"` /
`\n`, and one the runtime signed carried a bare quote into the
envelope; `extract_raw` ended a `data` value at its first `,` or `}`,
cutting Active Storage's object payloads short. Both directions are
ActiveSupport's JSON now (`<`, `>`, `&` escaped; control characters as
`\n` or `\u00XX`; `\uXXXX` and surrogate pairs decoded), byte-wise so
CRuby and spinel agree, and `extract_raw` reads a whole JSON value. The
`json_string` and `app_verifiers.data` sections hold it to Rails' bytes
(16/20 and 4/7 before).

**On the spinel binary** (`tests/rails_compat_vectors_spinel.rs`): the
same driver, compiled by spinel over sp_crypto and run under CRuby over
OpenSSL, must print identical tables; the 155 clock-stable cases do.
Running them there found a defect none of Rails' vectors could show —
**FIXED**: the binary derived its signing keys through
`sp_crypto_b64url_decode`, which returns a C string with no length, so a
derived key holding a zero byte was cut at the zero. About one
SECRET_KEY_BASE in five derives such a key (429 of 2,000 sampled); on
those deployments every signed cookie, signed id, sgid and blob URL the
binary made was signed with a key a few bytes long — forgeable, and
matching nothing Rails signs. The key is decoded in Ruby now
(`runtime/spinel/message_digest.rb`), and `nul_key` cases — secrets
whose keys hold a zero, answered by OpenSSL — pin it. sp_crypto's HMAC
itself is binary-safe (it reads the key's length off the String), so
web push's HKDF was never affected.

**The other direction** — Rails verifying what the runtime signs — needs
no separate harness where generation is byte-identical to Rails', which
is every deterministic section above; it matters where randomness is
involved (encryption IVs, CSRF masks), which is exactly what is not
implemented.

### Campfire's rich-text pipeline against Rails' corpus — BASELINE (2026-09-30)

`scripts/campfire-richtext-corpus` renders once-campfire-rust's corpus of
stored message bodies — 247 handwritten (fixtures, Lexxy and Trix
mentions, figures, galleries, remote images and video, content
attachments, opengraph embeds, sgids good / tampered / expired /
cross-purpose / Rails-7 / deleted, autolinks, hostile markup), 400
seeded fuzz, 400 seeded mutations — through campfire's own
`message_presentation` and `body.to_plain_text`, served by Rails and by
the emit from the same database, and compares case by case. Their
generator, vendored and run by our oracle, reproduces their recorded
answers byte for byte on all 647 cases the two corpora share, and the
Rails-served page matches the generator on every case it serves (49
bodies make Rails itself raise; the emit must raise on them too).

| presentation, bytes / DOM | handwritten (247) | fuzz (400) | mutation (400) |
|---|---|---|---|
| ruby (the real sanitizer gems) | 152 / 209 | 147 / 216 | 242 / 277 |
| spinel (the ported sanitizer) | 128 / 196 | 98 / 191 | 181 / 228 |

`DOM` is their normalization (HTML5 fragment, whitespace-only text
dropped, whitespace collapsed, attributes sorted). Plain text: ruby
208 / 85 / 246, spinel 206 / 85 / 244.

**Where the gap is.** At the DOM level 344 presentation failures are
shared by both lanes and 88 are spinel's alone. The 88 are the ported
sanitizer — what swapping in spinel-loofah under rails-html-sanitizer
is for. The 344 are roundhouse's compilation of campfire's pipeline,
whatever sanitizer runs under it; by cluster:

- **A bare `<` truncated the message — FIXED 2026-09-30.** `1 < 2 && 3
  > 2` rendered `1 `: Action Text's scanners (`next_element`,
  `element_end`, `to_plain_text`, `scan_tags`) took any `<` for a tag,
  and SanitizeTags removed `< 2 && 3 >` and everything after it. They
  now ask `ActionView::ViewHelpers.tag_open_at?`, HTML5's tag-open rule
  the sanitizer engine already used — corrected on the way for `</` +
  non-letter, which is a bogus comment the tokenizer drops, not text.
  Presentation DOM after: ruby 212 / 251 / 304, spinel 199 / 212 / 253;
  plain text ruby 210 / 108 / 274. Two fuzz cases (278, 349) that
  passed by accident — the misread `<` swallowed what Rails' tree
  builder drops — fail now, exposing the real gap: the fragment scanner
  is not an HTML5 tree builder (an unclosed `<textarea>` is RCDATA to
  the end; table content foster-parents out of `<form>`).
- **Trix figures** (`<figure data-trix-attachment=…>`, what older
  installs stored) are not converted: a mention inside one renders as
  its name, an image not at all.
- **Remote image and video attachments, content attachments
  (`text/html` with `content=`) and galleries** render empty.
- **A mention's plain text** keeps the HTML in the user's name, where
  Rails strips it.
- Byte-level only, DOM-equivalent: a newline after each mention's
  `</span>` and a blank line after each opengraph embed (a partial's
  trailing newline Rails trims), `href` / `target` order and `'` versus
  `&#39;` in autolinks.

A report, not yet a gate: the floors above become a ratchet once the
spinel lane runs the real sanitizer packages.

### Campfire's models write what Rails writes — MEASURED (2026-09-29)

`scripts/campfire-db-differential` runs once-campfire-rust's model
scenario (30-odd operations: messages and boosts created and
destroyed, an STI `becomes!`, closed and direct rooms, a membership's
connection counter, ban/unban, deactivation, search history, a bot and
its webhook, account settings) from campfire's fixtures, on Rails
(`rails runner`) and through the transpiled models (the same statements
in an overlay controller, one GET), then diffs every table with random
and clock values reduced to their shape. Then Rails boots on the
database the emit wrote and reads, authenticates, searches, edits and
deletes through Active Record.

**Both lanes: 13 of 13 tables match, rollback 17/17.** `memberships`
passes under one printed forgiveness — the `insert_all` entry above
(ids assigned in another order, microsecond timestamps where SQLite
stamps milliseconds). Everything else is Rails' rows.

It got there by finding seven defects, each fixed and each pinned in
`tests/model_scenario_lowerings.rs` or `tests/spinel_db_lease.rs`:

- `Room.find(id).messages.create!(…)` stayed on the plain reader's
  Array (`create!` for an instance of Array): the association
  constructor rewrite now takes any owner expression, which it names
  once.
- A scope-free app skipped the scope pass entirely, so its association
  constructors never rewrote at all.
- A local assigned inside `begin … rescue` read as unresolved after it,
  and the rewrites keyed on its type silently declined.
- `pluck(:id)` on a parameter holding an Array (`Rooms::Direct.find_for`)
  had no Array `pluck`.
- The mocha slot guard prepended to a stubbed app method named
  `MochaStub`, which only the test helper loaded: destroying a
  membership 500'd on both lanes in production.
- `has_rich_text`'s `dependent: :destroy` was not expanded: a destroyed
  message left its body in `action_text_rich_texts`.
- An attribute-hash `update!(status: …)` wrote `created_at` back EMPTY:
  its temporal normalize sat behind a `.to_s.nil?` that is never true.

### A raise inside a request leaked its connection lease (spinel) — FIXED

`Db.with_connection` (`runtime/spinel/db.rb`) released its lease only on
the happy path — its comment called that "acceptable on the happy path;
revisit if the dispatch path starts raising". Every 500 leaked one
connection for good; after a pool shard's worth (4) the next lease on
that shard parked forever, and every request served by a thread
assigned to that shard hung. Any signed-in user who could reach a 500
four times could take a shard down. Found by `campfire-http-shape`,
whose sweep alternates routes and so kept landing the one that raised
on the same shard: the binary stopped answering it after four. The
release is in an `ensure` now (`capture_sql` in the same file has used
one on this lane all along); `tests/spinel_db_lease.rs` raises more
times than the pool holds and checks the pool is whole again.

### Array form params (`ids[]`) kept only the last value (spinel) — FIXED

`Tep::Url.parse_query` stored a form body into a String→String hash, so
repeated `user_ids[]=2&user_ids[]=3` keys kept the last value, and
`Main.nest_params` then read `user_ids[]` as a sub-hash with the key
`""`: the controller saw `{"" => "3"}` where Rails sees `["2", "3"]`.
campfire's `Rooms::DirectsController#create` does
`User.where(id: params.fetch(:user_ids, []).including(Current.user.id))`,
so on the binary every new direct room was created with its creator
alone, and the request answered 302 as if it had worked. The cable
walk's direct-room probes checked status codes only and stayed green.
`nest_params` also knew one level of one resource per request, and let
the body win over the query string, where Rails lets the query win.

`runtime/spinel/param_builder.rb` is now a port of Rails' own
`QueryParser.each_pair` + `ParamBuilder#store_nested_param`, and
`Main.request_params` merges body, query and path captures in Rails'
order, answering 400 where Rails does. It is held to Rails' answers
for 2,755 query strings (`tests/params_vectors/`, borrowed from
once-campfire-rust and regenerated byte-identical with our oracle's
bundle), under CRuby and compiled by spinel
(`tests/spinel_param_builder.rs`); the walk's group-room probe checks
the members are there.

**Still open, smaller:** a MULTIPART body's text fields reach the
builder by name from its parser (`Tep::Request#body_fields`), so a
repeated field in a multipart form still keeps its last value. The
other targets keep their own nesting (the Python overlay's
`_nest_params`, Elixir's `nest_params`), not held to these vectors.

### The spinel binary WEDGES after a queued job raises — OPEN

**Found 2026-08-31**, and it blocks the cable walk and the browser
milestone on the spinel lane. Introduced with the in-process job queue
(`3aed469c`), not by anything since.

Before any job runs, the binary is healthy:

```
$ curl -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code} %{time_total}s' http://127.0.0.1:59444/
302 0.000974s          # and 0.0% CPU at idle
```

After one queued job raises, it serves nothing at all:

```
[tep 0.8.1-vendored] listening on http://0.0.0.0:59273 (workers=1)
[job] a queued job raised: uninitialized constant ThreadPoolExecutor
        ← no further output, ever
```

`sample(1)` puts 100% of the main thread in `sp_Scheduled_s_run_worker`
— `Tep::Server::Scheduled.run_worker`'s `while alive_count > 0;
tick(1000); end` — and `curl` against the bound port times out. Observed
twice, independently: the cable walk's binary (spun 53 minutes, 13 past
its own `timeout 2400`, until reaped by hand) and the archive's binary
under `scripts/smoke campfire`, whose log has ZERO `[WebServer]` lines
after the raise.

**A THEORY, not a diagnosis.** `Scheduler.tick` marks the fiber it is
about to resume with `sched_wake_at[best] = -1`, and its readiness test
is `sched_wake_at[i] <= now`. Since `-1 <= now` is always true, a fiber
that yields WITHOUT re-arming its wake time is permanently ready:
`any_time_ready` then forces `poll_round(0)`, which never blocks, and the
loop spins while starving the accept fiber. The `-1` hazard is known and
already guarded at both ordinary yield points — `pause` re-arms, and
`io_wait` says so explicitly ("-1 would mean 'ready now' to the tick
picker, so use a far-future wake_at as the sentinel"). So the suspect is
a third path that reaches `Fiber.yield` without re-arming, on or near the
`Db.with_connection { ActiveJob.drain }` line in the scaffold's
`job_loop`. `ActiveJob.drain` itself is not obviously at fault: it
rescues `StandardError`, `NameError` is one, and the log line proves the
rescue ran.

**Why no existing gate sees it.** The ruby lane holds jobs
(`enqueue_without_running`) and runs under Puma, so neither
`campfire-suite` nor `scripts/campfire-e2e` ever drains a raising job on
this server. `scripts/smoke campfire` DOES hit it, and stays green,
because the only spec that posts a message is `test.fixme`.

**`ThreadPoolExecutor` is the trigger, not the bug.** It is
concurrent-ruby (campfire's suite also wants `Concurrent::CyclicBarrier`).
Any raising job wedges the server the same way; a missing constant is
merely the one this app reaches first.

**The trigger is gone (2026-09-14), the entry stays.** `Concurrent::
ThreadPoolExecutor`, `FixedThreadPool` and `CyclicBarrier` are ported
over spinel's own threads (`runtime/spinel/concurrent.rb`; the ruby
family runs the gem), `Net::HTTP::Persistent` has a client on spinel
(`runtime/spinel/net_http.rb` — a connection per request, since the
package keeps none alive), and the config value that holds the pool is
built once per process rather than per read (`config.x.<key>` readers
memoize; see `ingest::app`). So `Room::PushMessageJob` runs, posts its
deliveries, and each one fails INSIDE the pool's own rescue — the
`WebPush.payload_send` façade raises, and `WebPush::Pool#deliver_later`
logs it — rather than out of the job. What a raising job does to the
scheduled server is untested since; the threaded server drains jobs on
a thread of its own.

**Since 2026-09-22 the façade does not raise:** delivery is the gem's on
the ruby family and a port of it on spinel (`runtime/spinel/web_push.rb`,
`web_push_crypto.rb` — byte-identical crypto, `tests/spinel_web_push_crypto.rs`).
The service worker and manifest it depends on are served since c89e3b22.
A delivery to a real push service is not yet confirmed.

### The threaded binary dies on more than one OS worker — CLOSED (runtime fixed upstream; the declaration is lifted)

The green-thread server (`runtime/spinel/tep/server_threaded.rb`) was
validated on ONE OS worker first. With spinel's autodetected worker
count, a browser's parallel load of the signed-in room page took the
binary down in 4 of 7 runs on a 16-core Linux box (gdb: `SIGSEGV` in
`sp_StrArray_scan` under `sp_gc_mark_drain` — a stop-the-world mark
reaching an `Array[String]` whose element was already freed), and in
one more run a cable subscribe never confirmed with the server alive.
`SPINEL_WORKERS=1`: 9 of 9 green. Diagnosed the same day with
`SPINEL_GC_VERIFY=1 SPINEL_GC_STRESS=1` and a TSan build:
matz/spinel#4272 — the boxed proc channel is per-worker TLS the barrier
never published, so a stale slot on an idle worker named an object
another worker's collection had freed — plus the per-class pool's
plain push under the parallel sweep. Both fixes merged upstream on
2026-09-02 (matz/spinel PRs #4273 and #4274). Meanwhile the program
declared one worker for itself on `main.rb`'s first line (the runtime
reads `SPINEL_WORKERS` at the first `Thread.new`, so the operator's
environment still won; matz/spinel#4266).

**Lifted.** On spinel master with both merges (cdf83a4a), the same
16-core loop with the autodetected worker count and no declaration:
10 of 10 runs alive and passing — no fault, no verifier report — and
the process observed at 9 OS threads under the browser's load (3 at
idle), so the workers were really there. The one symptom that remained
on that runtime was not the collector's: a cable subscribe that never
confirmed, and a browser reporting an invalid HTTP response on an
asset or on the cable handshake. That was ours — the next entry — and
with it fixed the loop is 10 of 10 green with no handshake error, and
10 of 10 again launched plain (no gdb, so address-space randomisation
on), server alive after each. One plain launch before those, made
before the exit status was being captured, reset the browser's
connections right after sign-in — not reproduced in the ten that
followed, and recorded here rather than explained away.
`SPINEL_WORKERS=N` in the environment still sets the count; the README
of each archive says so.

### A prepared statement crossed connections through one shared out-buffer — CLOSED (ours)

The campfire binary on 12 OS workers died inside SQLite within a second
of sixteen parallel room-page requests, about one run in two:
`sqlite3_clear_bindings` from `Db.finalize`, with six other workers
inside the library on their own connections at that moment (filed as
matz/spinel#4312 with what the bisection ruled out — a 4 GB collection
budget still crashed, so not the collector; a pool of one or two
connections was clean, so it needed parallel connections; the lease, the
pool's `Mutex`/`ConditionVariable` and `Thread.current` held up in a
64-thread standalone on 12 workers; the empty room page was clean). The
cable sweep then hit the same wall on FOUR workers at 300 sockets: the
connect storm's presence writes.

**Mechanism.** `DbConn#prepare_cached` prepared through `SQL.stmt_out`,
an `ffi_buffer` — ONE 8-byte block of static C storage for the whole
process — and read the statement pointer back out of it. Two workers
preparing at the same moment wrote in turn and one read the other's
pointer: a statement then belonged to two connections, one connection's
cache held a handle it never prepared, and the next reset, clear or
finalize on it from either side was undefined behaviour inside SQLite.
Every row of the bisection follows: the seeded room page prepares
constantly (with the bind gate off every value is a new SQL string), the
empty page barely prepares at all, one connection serialises the
prepares behind the lease, and no collector is involved.

**Fix.** The prepare and the read of its out-buffer are one critical
section under `Db.prepare_lock` (a module-level `Mutex`); no raise
inside it, since `synchronize` carries no ensure on this lane. A
per-thread or per-connection out-buffer would remove the lock; the FFI
declares buffers once per module today, and a prepare is short.

### N cable sockets on one binary: the connect storm, the idle cost, and fan-out per subscriber — MEASURED (2026-09-03)

`scripts/campfire-cable-sweep` drives the campfire binary with N held-open
Action Cable sockets (`scripts/campfire-cable-sweep.rb`: a stdlib RFC 6455
client on one `IO.select` loop, each socket signed in as a seeded user and
subscribed to the stream its room page names), pinned to a CPU set so a
tier of once.com/campfire's table runs on its own core count. Four cores,
four workers, the 1,000-user seed, roundhouse 74222ab8 on spinel 7182e9b6:

| sockets | rooms | connect storm | idle CPU | idle RSS | frames delivered | fan-out p50 / p99 | last frame p99 |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 10 | 1 | 6 ms | 0.003 cores | 30 MB | 300 / 300 | 45 / 58 ms | 59 ms |
| 30 | 1 | 14 ms | 0.005 cores | 33 MB | 900 / 900 | 46 / 69 ms | 70 ms |
| 100 | 2 | 40 ms | 0.010 cores | 43 MB | 1500 / 1500 | 39 / 70 ms | 72 ms |
| 300 | 6 | 0.13 s | 0.028 cores | 89 MB | 1500 / 1500 | 32 / 55 ms | 61 ms |
| 300 | 1 | 0.13 s | 0.029 cores | 77 MB | 9000 / 9000 | 46 / 69 ms | 77 ms |
| 1000 | 20 | 0.53 s | 0.129 cores | 184 MB | 1500 / 1500 | 34 / 65 ms | 67 ms |
| 1000 | 1 | 0.57 s | 0.134 cores | 143 MB | 30000 / 30000 | 121 / 178 ms | 199 ms |
| 3000 | 20 | 4.3 s | 0.58 cores | 296 MB | 4500 / 4500 | 94 / 158 ms | 180 ms |
| 5000 | 20 | 11.6 s | 0.57 cores | 433 MB | 7500 / 7500 | 171 / 315 ms | 423 ms |

The table's 1,000-user row is 4 CPUs and 8 GB; at that size the binary
idles at 3% of a core and 184 MB and delivers every frame. Rooms hold 50
subscribers from 100 sockets up (150 and 250 at 3,000 and 5,000), so the
fan-out per message is the same size through 1,000; a message to a room
of 1,000 costs 225 µs per delivered frame and the last subscriber gets it
50 ms after the first, which is our serial fan-out from the posting thread.

**The walls, in the order the sweep met them.** At 300 on four workers the
connect storm crashed the server: matz/spinel#4312, the shared prepare
out-buffer above, ours. At 1,000 every connection past about 450 was lost
silently: matz/spinel#4314, `IO#wait_readable` refusing a descriptor at
or past 1024 in front of a park that polls; fixed upstream the same night
(7182e9b6), which is what makes the 1,000 row and beyond measurable. From
1,000 to 5,000 the cost per connect quintuples (0.53 to 2.1 ms) and the
fan-out latency triples at a constant room size: matz/spinel#4317, every
wake in the monitor costs O(parked threads) — a standalone puts it at
8.5 µs per wake with nothing parked and 86 µs with 5,000 parked, linear.
Readings that did not survive and are withdrawn: the single-writer SQLite
theory (this storm subscribes only the message stream and writes
nothing), the listen backlog (1024, overflow counters unmoved), and "the
monitor pinned at a full core" (it was, under 568 dead threads; with the
descriptor fix the busiest thread in a 1,000-connect storm is 15–20% of a
core).

**What that table is, and is not.** Every row above was taken with ONE
subscription per socket and no presence, which is the shape the driver
had; it is a floor, and the rows are kept as measured rather than
restated. The driver has since grown the second subscription a real
campfire tab opens — `{"channel":"PresenceChannel","room_id":N}` on the
same consumer — so a connect storm now costs a `memberships` UPDATE per
socket and a disconnect storm another. Re-measuring the tier with
presence on is a re-run of the same script, and the two shapes are
distinguished in every result (`"presence": true|false`).

Still not covered: room-page load under concurrency, which is the other
half of the workload and where the thread server is weakest (the
interleaving cost on matz/spinel#4306); and payloads lighter than
production's (the attachment gaps are a ledgered bias).

### The same script drives Rails, on the same cores — the two-lane sweep

`scripts/campfire-cable-sweep --lane rails` boots campfire itself out of
the `scripts/campfire-oracle` tree — clustered Puma at `WEB_CONCURRENCY`,
Redis for both the cable adapter and the fragment cache, production env,
pinned to the same CPU set — and runs the SAME driver against it. A
number from either lane produced by a different script is not a
comparison, so there is one script.

**Three things had to be true first, and each was found by trying.**

1. *Sign-in does not scale, on either lane.* campfire rate-limits
   `SessionsController#create` to 10 per 3 minutes per IP (measured: the
   8th sign-in answers 429) and each one is a bcrypt. The driver signs in
   through the real form with the `authenticity_token` now — Rails
   refuses a POST without it, and a driver that skipped the token would
   only ever have run against the lane that forgives it — but above a few
   dozen sockets it takes `--cookies`, one pre-minted signed
   `session_token` per line. `scripts/campfire-oracle cookies` mints them
   through Rails' own cookie jar against the seed's deterministic token
   shape. ONCE answers the same problem the same way: their harness ships
   10,000 pre-forged cookies.

2. *One cookie file has to work on both lanes*, which is the PBKDF2
   iteration fix below.

3. *CPU and RSS have to be read off the process TREE.* The binary is one
   process; clustered Puma is a master and N forked workers, and sampling
   the master alone would have charged Rails almost nothing for almost
   everything it did. The driver rediscovers the tree on every sample
   (Puma replaces a reaped worker) and reports PSS beside RSS, because a
   forked worker's copy of a shared page is counted once per worker in
   the first and split between them in the second — RSS alone would
   invent a penalty the clustered lane does not pay, PSS alone would
   break comparison with the single-process rows already measured.

### Signed cookies interoperate with Rails — CLOSED (ours)

`ActionController::MessageVerifier` derived its key with 65_536 PBKDF2
iterations, and every test we run derived it the same way on both sides,
so nothing noticed that no Rails app uses that number.
`ActiveSupport::KeyGenerator.new(secret)` defaults to 2**16;
`Rails::Application#key_generator` — which is what every signed cookie
and every signed id in a Rails app actually goes through — passes
`iterations: 1000`.

**Measured, not read.** A `session_token` cookie minted by campfire under
Rails 8.2 through the app's own `ActionDispatch::Cookies::CookieJar`
reproduces bit for bit at PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256(secret, `"signed cookie"`,
1_000, 64) then HMAC-SHA1, and at no other point in the
{1_000, 65_536} x {SHA1, SHA256}^2 grid. Before the change the emitted
binary answered 302 to a cookie Rails had just issued for a session row
its own database held; after it, 200. ONCE's own load harness had the
number all along — `test/performance/create_dummy_cookies.rb` forges its
10,000 cookies with `KeyGenerator.new("dummy", iterations: 1000)`, which
had been read here as a bug in their script.

This is what lets the cable sweep hand ONE cookie file to both lanes, and
it is the precondition the unsigned-stream-name entry above was waiting
on.

**A signed id's envelope was wrong too, and is fixed with it.** Rails 8.2
mints `record.signed_id(purpose: :avatar)` as
`{"_rails":{"data":1,"pur":"user/avatar"}}`, URL-safe base64 with no
padding — the id embedded as JSON, and NO `exp` key at all when there is
no expiry — where this file built the cookie jar's
`{"_rails":{"message":"<base64>","exp":null,"pur":…}}` in strict base64.
Both are `ActiveSupport::Messages::Metadata`; which one it writes depends
on whether the verifier's serializer can carry the metadata itself, and
the cookie jar's cannot (it signs an already-serialized String) while the
signed-id verifier's can. Same secret, same salt, same digest — three
different bytes. `MessageVerifier.data_envelope` /
`verified_data_json` are the second face, and `ActiveRecord::SignedId`
reads them.

**Why nothing caught either.** The unit vectors were real ActiveSupport
output from a HAND-ASSEMBLED verifier — `KeyGenerator.new(SECRET,
hash_digest_class: SHA256)` and `MessageVerifier.new(key, serializer:
JSON)` — which is a configuration no Rails application has: the app's
generator passes 1_000 iterations and the app's verifier picks the other
envelope. Two wrong answers, both correctly signed, pinned as ground
truth. They come from campfire itself now, minted through `signed_id` and
`CookieJar.build` (the runner is in the test's header) — a vector is the
APP's output or it is not an oracle. `scripts/campfire-compare` could not
have caught it either: it masks "signed blobs (avatar sgids, stream
signatures)" as volatile, which is exactly the bytes that were wrong.
The unit harness also loaded CRuby's stdlib `Base64` where an emitted
ruby tree ships the one in `runtime/spinel/base64.rb`, emitted to
runtime/base64.rb in the tree — which is why `write_bundled_requires`
skips the stdlib require for it. The harness loads the one that ships
now, and that is what made the missing `urlsafe_encode64_nopad` visible.

### A channel's `on_subscribe` / `on_unsubscribe` callbacks run — CLOSED (ours)

`on_subscribe :present, unless: :subscription_rejected?` landed in
`unknown_calls` and was dropped with a `lower_residue` warning, because
it is an `ActiveSupport::Callbacks` chain and there is no such thing in
an emitted tree. campfire's `PresenceChannel` does ALL of its work in
those two hooks: `present` is the `memberships` UPDATE that records
somebody as being in a room, `absent` the one that takes them out. So the
binary subscribed correctly, delivered every frame, and wrote nothing —
invisible to the cable walk (which asserts frames) and invisible to the
suite (Rails' `Channel::TestCase` builds the channel itself). The cable
sweep found it by running the two lanes side by side: eight sockets, and
Rails had eight `connected_at` rows where the binary had none.

`ingest::channel_callbacks` consumes the declarations and inlines the
chain — guards and all, ancestors first — into one generated method per
hook:

```ruby
def after_subscribe
  present if !(subscription_rejected?)
  nil
end
```

A method rather than a table, for the reason every lowering here prefers
one: a chain walked at run time is a list of Symbols a static target
cannot dispatch. Inlined rather than `super`, because the parent chain is
a compile-time fact and a virtual call is not free on the strict targets.
A block form (`on_subscribe { … }`) or a lambda guard is left in
`unknown_calls` with its warning rather than half-modelled.

Both lanes call both hooks. The overlay's `Cable::Dispatch` already kept
the channel object for the life of the subscription; the spinel lane now
keeps confirmed channels on the per-connection `Cable::WsMessage` handler
and a new `Cable::WsClose` walks them under a database lease when the
socket closes. Verified against Rails on the same seed: eight rows during
the idle phase on both lanes, zero after teardown on both.

### The 1,000-user tier, both lanes, same cores — MEASURED (2026-09-04)

**Correction, 2026-09-04 (later the same day).** The idle-CPU doubling this
entry attributes to the second registered stream per socket is not the
streams. The idle cost is the monitor's turn rate times a `poll` over
every parked socket, and the turn rate is set by how spread the
per-connection ping phases are: a second subscription only made the
connect storm ten times longer (a presence write per connect through
SQLite's sleeping busy handler), which spread the phases. Same binary,
1,000 sockets, 4 workers on 4 cores: one subscription after a 0.55 s
storm idles at 0.132 cores (monitor blocking 65 turns/s); two
subscriptions after a 6.2 s storm at 0.234 (182/s); ONE subscription with
the connects paced 6 ms apart, a 6.6 s storm, at 0.396 (337/s). Real
connections arrive over minutes, so the paced row is the honest idle
number for a per-connection heartbeat: one monitor turn per beat, ~1.1 ms
of `poll` over 1,000 TCP sockets per turn. Reproduced in matz's standalone
by staggering its heartbeat starts (0.021 cores started together, 0.375
staggered, 0.010 with one shared heartbeat; matz/spinel#4317). The idle
axis is therefore mostly ours: a shared heartbeat, Action Cable's shape,
is the next change; the population term, a `poll` over everyone parked
on every event, stays the runtime's and is what #4317 asks for.

once.com/campfire's table puts 1,000 concurrent users on 4 CPUs and
8 GB. Both lanes on `taskset -c 0-3`, the same 1,000-user / 20-room seed,
the same pre-minted cookie file, and the same driver: the binary on four
OS workers, campfire on `WEB_CONCURRENCY=3` (its own
`(processor_count * 0.666).ceil` at four cores) x 5 threads, production,
Redis for the cable adapter and the fragment cache. Every socket holds
the two subscriptions a real tab holds, so every connect is a
`memberships` UPDATE and every close another. roundhouse 883db7a5 on
spinel 7182e9b6, Rails 8.2.0.alpha @ 1a02651a, campfire @ 94a48aac.

| N | lane | connect storm | storm CPU | idle CPU | idle RSS / PSS | frames | fan-out p50 / p99 | last frame p99 | chat CPU | teardown CPU |
|--:|--|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| 100 | binary | 0.87 s | 0.24 s | 0.013 cores | 56 / 44 MB | 500 / 500 | 51 / 79 ms | 80 ms | 0.036 cores | 0.14 s |
| 100 | rails | 0.62 s | 1.52 s | 0.009 cores | 741 / 514 MB | 500 / 500 | 38 / 204 ms | 207 ms | 0.105 cores | 0.39 s |
| 300 | binary | 2.48 s | 0.80 s | 0.040 cores | 73 / 62 MB | 1500 / 1500 | 40 / 74 ms | 76 ms | 0.083 cores | 0.37 s |
| 300 | rails | 1.10 s | 2.86 s | 0.005 cores | 794 / 586 MB | 1500 / 1500 | 32 / 299 ms | 303 ms | 0.182 cores | 0.63 s |
| 1000 | binary | 6.70 s | 3.99 s | 0.243 cores | 143 / 133 MB | 1500 / 1500 | 38 / 76 ms | 81 ms | 0.285 cores | 1.46 s |
| 1000 | rails | 2.35 s | 5.86 s | 0.013 cores | 902 / 697 MB | 1500 / 1500 | 33 / 201 ms | 207 ms | 0.170 cores | 1.57 s |

Both lanes deliver every frame at every size. Nothing here is published;
the plan defers that until the binary is competitive, and on one axis it
is not.

**Memory: the binary, by 5x.** 133 MB of PSS against 697 MB at 1,000
sockets — 2% of the tier's 8 GB against 9%. RSS reads higher for Rails
still (902 MB) because three forked workers each carry their own copy of
a page; PSS is the fair number and the binary wins on either.

**Idle CPU: Rails, by 19x, and this is the thing to fix.** 0.013 cores
against 0.243 to hold a thousand silent sockets. Action Cable runs ONE
shared heartbeat off its reactor's select timeout; this lane runs a ping
thread per connection and every wake of the monitor costs O(parked
threads) — matz/spinel#4317, already filed with a standalone that puts
it at 15 ns per parked thread per wake.

**And the second subscription is most of it, which #4317 does not
explain.** The same 1,000 sockets holding ONE subscription idle at 0.136
cores (and storm in 0.57 s for 1.15 CPU-s, teardown 0.22 s) — the same
number of connections, the same number of ping threads, the same parked
count. Holding 2,000 subscriptions instead of 1,000 costs ~1.5x the idle
CPU on a workload where neither subscription receives anything. Not a
drain: over a 90-second idle it settles at 0.207 cores rather than
falling back. Something in the per-connection write path is O(registered
streams) and it is the next probe.

**Fan-out: the binary's tail, Rails' median.** 38 vs 33 ms at the 50th
percentile, 76 vs 201 ms at the 99th. Net of the idle tax the binary also
does the work more cheaply: subtracting each lane's own idle draw from
its chat window leaves ~0.041 cores against ~0.157 for the same 1,500
delivered frames. The binary is ~3.8x cheaper at delivering, and pays a
quarter of a core to hold the sockets it delivers to.

**Connect storm: Rails, on wall time; the binary, on CPU.** 2.35 s
against 6.70 s to subscribe 1,000 sockets and write 1,000 presence rows,
for 5.86 CPU-seconds against 3.99. Three processes x five threads have
more hands than four workers do, and the binary's presence writes
serialize harder behind one SQLite writer. Teardown is a tie (1.46 vs
1.57 CPU-s), which is the first time the disconnect half has been
measured on either lane.

### The idle axis, both halves of it — MEASURED (2026-09-04)

The 1,000-user tier above loses idle CPU to Rails by 19x. Two changes
land on that axis the same day, one upstream and one here, and each was
measured with the other held still.

**Theirs.** matz/spinel#4317 asked for persistent readiness registration
in the scheduler's monitor: a wake handed the whole parked population to
`poll(2)`, and a server's parked threads are its idle connections. It was
answered in a day — `692e50b2` puts the readiness set in an epoll set,
`1c34d424` carries the same contract to kqueue, `1c269a3c` moves the set
into each worker so a wake needs no hand-off (the half #4306 left open).

**Ours.** A green thread per connection sleeping three seconds is the
best case only while the connections' beat phases coincide. Real
connections arrive over minutes, the phases spread, and the monitor turns
once per beat. `Cable` now keeps a registry of open drivers on `Tep::APP`
and one thread beats all of them — Action Cable's shape, and the CRuby
overlay's `Reactor#beat` already.

#### The runtime change, one binary against itself

`SPINEL_SCHED_POLL=1` keeps the old path, so these columns are the same
binary on the same cores in the same hour with a ping thread per
connection in both. Four cores pinned, four workers, the 1,000-user /
20-room seed, two subscriptions per socket. `scripts/campfire-cable-sweep
--env` is what holds the binary still.

| N | storm CPU | | idle cores | | fan-out p99 | |
|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| | poll | epoll | poll | epoll | poll | epoll |
| 300 | 0.77 s | 0.74 s | 0.046 | **0.016** | 63 ms | 60 ms |
| 1000 | 3.88 s | **2.64 s** | 0.251 | **0.052** | 95 ms | 75 ms |
| 3000 | 15.22 s | **8.99 s** | 0.470 | **0.154** | 169 ms | 173 ms |
| 5000 | 32.90 s | **18.28 s** | 0.465 | **0.211** | 377 ms | 334 ms |

Every cell delivers every frame on both backends. Storm WALL time barely
moves — the storm is not CPU-bound, it is N presence INSERTs through one
SQLite writer — but the CPU spent getting there nearly halves at the top,
and idle falls by 2.2x to 4.9x with nothing else changed.

#### The heartbeat, and the burst it made

One shared beat took 1,000 sockets from 0.052 to 0.009 idle cores — and
put every connection's frame in the same instant. That burst is
measurable, and the sweep's driver is the first thing it hits: one Ruby
thread reading every socket has to drain N pings before it can stamp the
next message. The driver now reports what it cost itself, which is what
separates the two.

| N=5000 | ping per connection | one beat | ten slices |
|--|--:|--:|--:|
| idle cores | 0.203 | **0.047** | **0.046** |
| fan-out p50 / p99 | 199 / 367 ms | 228 / 1402 ms | 208 / 543 ms |
| driver's longest reading pass | 101 ms | 791 ms | 146 ms |
| server CPU through the chat window | 0.404 cores | **0.281** | **0.312** |

About two thirds of the p99 the unsliced beat added is the driver's own
backlog. `beat_cycle` therefore walks the registry in `BEAT_SLICES`
pieces spread across the interval: every connection is still pinged once
per `PING_INTERVAL`, ten slices divide the burst by ten, and the monitor
pays ten wakes an interval instead of the 333 a second a thread per
connection costs at 1,000 sockets. At 3,000 the sliced beat is at or
better than the per-connection thread on every column (p99 166 vs 176 ms,
idle 0.027 vs 0.144); at 5,000 its p99 is still the worse of the two (543
vs 367) and 44 ms of that gap is the driver again. 5,000 is a tier past
the one campfire's table asks for and the idle number there is 4.4x
better, so this is recorded rather than chased.

#### Where the 1,000-user tier stands now

The honest cell is the PACED one — connects 6 ms apart, so the beat
phases are spread the way a deployment spreads them, which is what
`--pace` exists for. Same seed, same cores, two subscriptions per socket.

| 1,000 sockets, paced | idle cores | fan-out p50 / p99 | chat CPU |
|--|--:|--:|--:|
| poll + thread per connection (2026-09-03) | 0.396 | — | — |
| epoll + thread per connection | 0.046 | 35 / 76 ms | 0.120 cores |
| epoll + one beat | 0.010 | 34 / 129 ms | 0.084 cores |
| **epoll + sliced beat** | **0.011** | **33 / 66 ms** | **0.085 cores** |
| Rails as ONCE deploys it (2026-09-04) | 0.013 | 33 / 201 ms | 0.170 cores |

The axis that was 19x against us is now level: 0.011 cores against
Rails' 0.013 to hold a thousand silent sockets, with the fan-out tail
three times better and the delivery CPU half. Memory was already 5x ours
and is unchanged. **Nothing here is published**; the plan still defers
that, but the reason it deferred — one axis we lost badly — is gone.

#### macOS runs the kqueue path, and it was untested under load

`1c34d424` went to CI without a Mac under load, and the shape to suspect
was a park that only ever ends on its timeout. 300 sockets in one room on
a 16-core Mac, 30 s idle then 20 posts: 300/300 subscribed in 0.16 s,
pings exactly on cadence, 6,000/6,000 frames at p50 19 ms / p99 32 ms,
clean teardown. No stall in any run; the beat count is where a
timeout-only park would have shown first.

#### Traps

* Editing a running bash script is editing what it is about to execute:
  the sweep died on `line 136: syntax error near unexpected token 'done'`
  in a cell whose file had been correct at launch. Copy it, or wait.
* A ping count read by the client cannot see a registry leak — a closed
  connection's driver refuses the write, so the leak is invisible at
  every socket and shows up only as work. `tests/spinel_cable_heartbeat.rb`
  reads the registry instead.
* The box's clock is CEST; a run that looks stalled against an EDT
  timestamp usually is not.

### The fiber server is back beside the threaded one, as a measurement lane — OPEN (matz/spinel#4306)

`Tep::Server::Scheduled` and `Tep::Scheduler` (the fiber-per-connection
server on one poll loop, retired on 2026-09-01) were restored on
2026-09-03, unchanged apart from a refused WebSocket upgrade, and every
binary now carries BOTH servers: `TEP_SERVER=fiber` selects the fiber
one in `scaffold/main.rb`, anything else the threaded one. The point is
a comparison with nothing else varying — same compiler, same emitted
tree, same database and pool, same process — because the blog bench had
shown the cost of the threaded design and the compiler was moving under
it at the same time: on 2026-09-03 the nightly's spinel lane read 7.9k
req/s where the night before it read 22.1k on `/articles/1.json`, and
separating the runtime's per-park cost (matz/spinel#4306), its
broadcast wake (#4305, fixed the same day) and a same-day compiler
regression (#4304, fixed) took a hand-rebuilt archive each time. The
bench harness carries the pair as `spinel` (threads, autodetected OS
workers) and `spinel-fiber` (the same binary, `TEP_SERVER=fiber
SPINEL_WORKERS=1`), and the report says what the pair measures.

**What the fiber lane is not.** An HTTP GET lane. A WebSocket upgrade
answers 501: the driver's recv loop wants a parked green thread, and on
this server it would run on the main thread and hold every other
connection. Spinel's `Thread#[]` is per green thread, not per fiber, so
the per-request state `thread_state.rb` keeps in `Thread.current` is
shared by every fiber on the main thread — correct while a request runs
from start to finish without yielding, which a GET does, and the reason
the campfire compare and cable gates stay on the threaded server. With
one worker the scaffold's job-loop thread never runs while the poll
loop holds the main thread. None of that is fixable without the fiber
scheduler learning what the runtime now does for threads, which is the
question #4306 asks the other way round.

**First observation, same binary, spinel 790db4cb, 16-core macOS,
`wrk -t2 -c64 -d3s /articles/1.json`:** fiber 32.6k req/s (p99 2.4 ms);
threads on the autodetected 16 workers 28.8k (p50 0.15 ms, p99 205 ms).
Before that day's runtime fixes the same pair on the same machine read
28.7k against 7.0k. The bench box's numbers are the bench page's.

### A WebSocket write addressed to an fd NUMBER reached the number's next owner — CLOSED

Found while lifting the one-worker declaration above, on the runtime
with both collector fixes: 2 of 5 browser runs stalled on tab A's
subscribe with the server alive and every OS worker idle, and a
passing run logged `WebSocket connection to 'ws://…/cable' failed:
Error during WebSocket handshake: net::ERR_INVALID_HTTP_RESPONSE`.
The traced server (a `warn` at welcome, EOF and every ping) made it
plain in one run: the socket on fd 40 read EOF at trace line 138, a
ping thread wrote to fd 40 at line 184 and the write SUCCEEDED, and
the next welcome on fd 40 came at line 185 — the browser's error that
run was `ERR_INVALID_HTTP_RESPONSE` on an asset fetch, the HTTP
connection that held the number in between. Line 426 was the same
for fd 31, whose socket had closed at 183. Over the ten control runs
the census is 5 such writes in 4 runs; one of the four reached the
browser as an error, the rest landed where nothing noticed.

**Mechanism.** `Cable.spawn_ping` gave each connection a green thread
that slept three seconds and wrote a ping to `ws.fd`, exiting when a
write FAILED. Closing the socket does not fail the next write: the
kernel hands a closed fd's number to the next `accept`, so the write
succeeds into a stranger — a WebSocket frame ahead of an HTTP
response (the asset error), ahead of a 101 (the handshake error), or
interleaved with another thread's frame on a live cable socket (a
frame the client cannot parse; it closes and reconnects, and if the
stray thread is still alive the reconnect meets it again — the
stall). `Tep::Broadcast.publish` had the narrower form of the same
race: it copied `(topic, fd)` pairs out under the registry lock and
wrote to the numbers outside it. Both are ours; neither is the
scheduler. One worker hid it only by odds.

**Fix.** The connection's `Tep::WebSocket::Driver` owns a write lock
and a `closed` flag: every frame goes through `write_frame`, which
takes the lock and refuses once `retire` has flipped the flag; the
server retires the driver after the recv loop returns and BEFORE it
closes the fd. A subscription now holds the driver, not the number,
and `publish` writes through it. The ping thread exits on the refused
write, within one interval of the close, never having touched the
number's next owner; the lock also serialises a broadcast against the
connection's own frames, so two threads no longer interleave bytes on
one socket. Every exit of the recv loop (idle timeout and protocol
error included) now dispatches close, so the registry drops the fd's
entries while the number is still uniquely the connection's. Rule:
**a thread may hold an fd NUMBER only through the object that owns
the fd, and that object decides when writes stop.**

### Tab B does not DISPLAY a message body that is present in its HTML — OPEN

Narrowed, not solved. Two browser tabs, one room; tab A posts. Tab B's
socket receives `<turbo-stream action="append" target="messages_room_1">`,
the row is inserted (`<div id="message_1" class="message …">` with the
author and the message-options control), and the body text is not
displayed.

**What was ruled out on 2026-08-31.** The server render is not at fault:
requested directly over HTTP with `Accept: text/vnd.turbo-stream.html`,
the same `Views::Messages.message(message)` returns `message__body`
markup containing the posted text. Both the broadcast
(`Message::Broadcasts#broadcast_create`) and the controller response
(`app/views/messages/create.rb`) call that one function with one
argument, so there is no second render path to disagree with the first.

**What an earlier version of this entry got wrong.** It read tab A as a
server render that worked and tab B as a broadcast render that dropped
the body. Tab A's row carried a CLIENT-generated id
(`message_lk96p3l27rr`) because it was campfire's own optimistic echo
from `app/views/messages/_template.rb` — the `$messageDatetime$`
template — not a server render at all. The comparison was between a
server render and a JavaScript one.

**Re-measured 2026-08-31, after both `<time>` defects closed.** On the
RUBY lane the milestone now PASSES outright — `cable.spec.js`,
un-`fixme`d, is green in 1.2s with the body displayed in both tabs. On
the SPINEL lane it still fails, with the row present and the body
absent. The two lanes emit BYTE-IDENTICAL helper source
(`TimeHelper.local_datetime_tag(message.created_at, :time, attributes)`
in both), so whatever remains is downstream of the shared lowering — in
the spinel target's emit, its runtime, or Tep — and NOT the tag-builder
family.

That measurement is not yet conclusive, because the spinel run also
wedges (see the entry above): the job raises moments after the post, so
"tab B never received it" and "tab B received it without a body" are not
yet distinguishable on that lane. The row IS present, which argues the
broadcast arrived before the wedge — but the walk, which would settle it
by reading the frame, cannot complete on the spinel lane until the wedge
is fixed. **Fix the wedge first; this entry is blocked behind it.**

**Why the cable walk does not see it.**
`scripts/campfire-cable-drive.rb` asserts `html.include?(BODY)` against
the raw frame — it reads the wire, not the DOM, and never renders. Same
shape as [[project_campfire_empty_message_bodies]]'s lesson ("an
emptiness test must not go through a renderer") from the opposite
direction: a wire test cannot see a client that fails to display bytes
it received intact.

Tracked by `e2e/campfire/cable.spec.js`, which is `test.fixme` until this
and the keep-alive serialization entry are closed.

### dom_id and STI — FIXED

**FIXED 2026-08-31.** The base model's synthesized `dom_prefix` is a
type-column dispatch now: `lower::sti_scope` — which already derives
the subclass→base map for relation scoping and `becomes!` — stamps the
subclass set onto the base Model (`sti_subclass_names`, the
self-describing-IR move), and `push_dom_prefix_method` emits
`case @type; when "Rooms::Open" then "rooms_open"; …; else "room"`.
Every lane answers the subclass's dom class for an STI row, exactly as
Rails' `dom_class` does, hydration class notwithstanding. The
comparator's mask is retired — a divergence here fails CI again — and
the browser spec's list locator went lane-agnostic
(`[id^="messages_"]`) so no spec re-couples to either spelling. The
original entry follows.

`dom_id(record)` derives its prefix from the record's CLASS, and for an
STI row that is the subclass: room 1 is a `Rooms::Open`, so Rails names
the room page's message list `messages_rooms_open_1`. The emit's
`dom_prefix` is synthesized per MODEL at lowering time and association
reads hydrate the base class, so the same list is `messages_room_1`.
Each lane is SELF-consistent — its broadcast frames target the element
its own pages render, which is why every behavioral gate passes on both
— but the DOMs differ, found by `scripts/campfire-compare` on its first
run (2026-08-31). The fix wants STI-aware hydration or a type-column
dispatch in `dom_prefix`; until then the comparator forgives exactly
this rewrite, by name.

### Broadcast row identity: client_message_id vs database id — FIXED

**FIXED 2026-08-31.** The mechanism was `Message#to_key` — campfire
overrides it to `[client_message_id]`, and Rails' `dom_id` derives its
identity half from `to_key.join("_")`, everywhere: page rows, broadcast
rows, and every `edit_`/`boosting_`/`presentation_` derivative. The
runtime's `dom_id` read `record.id` directly. Now the lowerer
synthesizes a per-model `dom_record_key` — `@id.to_s` by default, the
model's own `to_key.join("_")` when it defines one (one String per
model, so the strict targets never union `Array[Integer]` with
`Array[String?]` across a poly slot) — and `dom_id` consumes it. The
comparator's mask is retired with the fix: every per-message id now
matches Rails byte for byte, and a divergence here fails CI again.
The user-visible half — Turbo's append replacing the sender's
optimistic echo instead of standing a duplicate row beside it — is
pinned by the browser milestone spec. The original entry follows.

campfire's broadcast render keys every per-message dom id off
`client_message_id` (`message_cable-walk-1`, and with it
`edit_message_…`, `boosting_…`, `boosts_…`, `presentation_…`), so the
sender's optimistic client-side echo — which minted that id — is
RECONCILED when the frame arrives. The emit keys the same ids off the
database id (`message_505`). Consequence beyond bytes: on the emit the
sender's tab may hold both its echo and the appended row, since nothing
shares an id to replace. Found by `scripts/campfire-compare`
(2026-08-31); the browser milestone passes because `toContainText` is
satisfied by either row. Fix belongs wherever the broadcast render
resolves `dom_id` for an unsaved-id context; forgiven by name in the
comparator until then.

### Broadcast forms and CSRF — FIXED

**FIXED 2026-08-31.** The renders the broadcast lowerings SYNTHESIZE
(the `broadcasts_to` expansions, `partial:` forms, and the
receiver-convention default) now ride inside the bracket pair

```ruby
ViewHelpers.broadcast_render(ViewHelpers.begin_broadcast_render,
                             Views::Messages.message(self))
```

and `csrf_token_hidden_input` — the one choke point every form's token
input flows through, `button_to`'s included now — answers `""` while
the flag is up. That is Rails' semantics arrived at honestly: its
broadcast renderer has no session, ours runs inside the triggering
request and had one at hand. An app-SUPPLIED `html:` expression passes
through unwrapped, which is also Rails: campfire's closeds controller
hands in a `render_to_string` rendered inside the request — session,
token and all — and Rails broadcasts those bytes untouched.

The bracket is TWO PLAIN CALLS riding left-to-right argument
evaluation — the first argument raises the flag before the render (the
second) runs. Three richer shapes were tried first, and each was
backed out by a lane that could not spell it:

  * a BLOCK (`broadcast_render { … }`) dissolves on the AOT lane —
    on the real tree the discriminator is an ensure-guarded
    `x = yield` inlined into a heap poly proc (matz/spinel#4245,
    rediagnosed with matz; small mirrors pass).
  * a `^() -> String` proc ARGUMENT (`blk.call`, the
    `ActiveJob.enqueue` contract) compiles on spinel but needs a
    `.call` + function-type arm in all nine target emitters the
    runtime file lowers through — CI showed kotlin (`Unresolved
    reference 'call'`), rust (unstable `fn_traits`) and five compare
    lanes red at once. The detour still paid: the RBS reader grew
    `ProcType`, the analyzer `.call`-on-`Ty::Fn`, and
    `active_job.rbs` now declares its queue `Array[^() -> nil]`
    instead of the documented `untyped` wart.
  * begin/`ensure` is a construct half the targets have no statement
    arm for, so the runtime body carries none. The flag self-heals
    instead: `reset_slots!` — every lane's per-request dispatch entry
    — clears it, so a render that raises can leave at most the
    REMAINDER of its own request token-less.

The chase also closed real typing gaps: `transaction { }` answers its
block, `tap` its receiver, and controller private-helper params take
the analyzer's call-site-unified types (`broadcast_create_room(Room
room)` where `(untyped room)` had poisoned every chain under it).

The comparator's last frame mask retires with this; the frames now
compare against Rails with NO forgivenesses on either lane. The
original entry follows.

A broadcast render has no session, and Rails' `form_with` omits the
`authenticity_token` hidden input there (campfire's JS supplies
`X-CSRF-Token` from the page meta on submit, so the forms still work).
The emit renders the token input unconditionally. Functionally
identical at submit time; a byte divergence in every boost form of
every broadcast frame. Found by `scripts/campfire-compare`
(2026-08-31); forgiven by name in the comparator.

### `<% cache %>` is served from `Rails.cache`

`lower::view_to_library::walker` lowers a view's fragment-cache block to
a read, a render into the site's own accumulator on a miss, and a write:

    __cache_hit_352 = Rails.cache.read_str("views/#{ViewHelpers.cache_scope}messages/_message/#{message.cache_key_with_version}/presentation-v2")
    if __cache_hit_352.nil?
      __cache_io_352 = String.new
      … body …
      io << Rails.cache.write_str(<same key>, __cache_io_352, 0)
    else
      io << __cache_hit_352
    end

**What it closed.** `/rooms/1/messages` cost 127 sqlite round trips
against Rails-as-deployed's 7 — and the 127 *was* Rails' own uncached
renderer, because campfire's messages index preloads only
`with_creator`, so boosts, rich text and attachments are N+1 in Rails
too. Rails' 7 was its Redis fragment cache. Because the cache block
wraps the WHOLE partial body, a hit runs none of it. Measured with
`scripts/campfire-queries` (2026-09-06): **7 vs 7**, and every other
route at or below Rails. That was the last query-parity gap.

**No template digest, unlike Rails.** Rails hashes the template and its
render tree into the key because Redis outlives the deploy that changed
the template. This store lives in the process: a template change means a
recompile, a new binary and an empty store, so the digest would be a
constant that changes exactly when the thing it guards is already gone.
An app's own manual version string still works — campfire's
`"presentation-v2"` is a literal and folds into the key's constant text
at compile time.

**The key builder DECLINES rather than guesses.** Only two element
shapes are claimed: a literal, and a name that is both one of this
view's locals and a model's snake singular. Anything else renders
transparently, which is what every site did before the store existed. A
key that misses costs a render; a key that collides, or that fails to
move when the row does, serves the WRONG BYTES — and nothing in this
repo would catch that, because `campfire-compare` renders each lane once
from cold. `model_singulars` alone would claim a helper named `message`;
`locals` alone would claim `notice`; the conjunction claims exactly the
Rails convention these partials are written to.

Not by TYPE, which was the first cut and declined every site in the
corpus: a view body reaches the walker as compiled ERB whose locals are
still bare `Send { recv: None }` barewords with `ty: None`, because
models type before views lower.

**Invalidation is `belongs_to … touch:`**, which is why that had to land
first (see its section above). Nothing deletes a fragment; the key moves
when `updated_at` does, and a boost's touch cascades through its Message
to its Room.

**Two stores answer `Rails.cache`** — the shared runtime's `Rails::Cache`
and the CRuby overlay's `Rails::MemoryStore` — and every method the
compiler emits a call to has to exist on both. `read_str`/`write_str`
landed on the shared one first and every campfire page 500'd on the
CRuby lane with `undefined method 'read_str'`; the suite went 256 -> 229
and `campfire-compare`'s emit walk died on the room page. Same shape as
the Db shims' parity rule.

**The lock is in the lane that needs it.** `runtime/ruby` is transpiled
to nine targets and cannot spell `Mutex`; the single-threaded lanes have
nothing to guard, rust and go already lock a class-level slot per
access, the CRuby overlay's store has held a Mutex since it was written
(Puma is threaded), and the spinel binary — a green thread per
connection, no GVL — gets `runtime/spinel/fragment_cache.rb`, a reopen
of the three state-touching methods that wins by load order the way
`csrf_token.rb` does. A read-then-write PAIR is deliberately not atomic
on any of them: holding a lock across the render would serialize every
request on the page's first fragment, and two threads that miss the same
key both render with one write winning — a duplicate render, not a wrong
answer.

**Known residue.** The shared store caps entries (5,000, FIFO — LRU
needs a touch on every READ, and the read path is what a fragment cache
exists to make cheap); the CRuby overlay's `MemoryStore` has no cap and
never had one, which mattered less before there were fragments in it.
The spinel lock compiles and serves but has not been load-tested under
green-thread contention.

### Room-page boost forms and the fragment cache

Rails fragment-caches each message row (`cache [ message,
"presentation-v2" ]`), and the cache keeps whatever render FIRST warmed
it: a page GET renders with a session, so the row's eight quick-boost
forms carry the `authenticity_token` hidden input; a broadcast renders
without one, so they don't. Token presence in the room page's boost
forms therefore encodes each row's RENDER HISTORY — after a cable post,
Rails' own page serves both spellings side by side (36 seeded rows with
tokens, the 4 cable-posted rows without, on the compare walk). The emit's
forms always carry the token, and since 2026-09-06 that is a DECISION
rather than an absence: it fragment-caches the same rows now, but the
key carries a `ViewHelpers.cache_scope` namespace, so a broadcast render
(which omits the token) and a request render (which does not) can never
be served for each other. Our entries are therefore always
session-rendered and always token-carrying. Rails puts both in one
namespace, which is exactly what makes its answer history-dependent.
Neither spelling is wrong to the app:
the JS submits with `X-CSRF-Token` from the page meta, which is why
Rails can ship the token-less cached copy at all.

Matching Rails here would mean reproducing not its renderer but its
cache's history-dependence — and now that we have a cache of our own,
matching it would mean deliberately DROPPING the namespace that keeps
the two renders apart, i.e. adopting the bug. So the comparator still
forgives exactly this, by name, and ONLY on the room page: the mask is scoped so a token reappearing in a broadcast FRAME
still fails the run (that ratchet is the "Broadcast forms and CSRF"
fix above). Found by `scripts/campfire-compare` when the room page was
triaged for gating (2026-09-01).

### An advisory `String?` erases nil on the binary — matz/spinel#4250 — FIXED upstream

**FIXED 2026-09-01** (spinel `2d59b3cd`, "Keep the nil arm an advisory
nilable seed promises"), the day it was filed; the fix landed with its
own regression test (`test/rbs-seed/nilable_return.rb`, our repro's
shape). Verified by the gate that found it:
`scripts/campfire-compare --spinel` is **fully green** — room page and
both frames equivalent to Rails on the compiled binary, with only the
fragment-cache forgiveness above still applied (a Rails-side
history-dependence, not a spinel gap). No mask to retire, because none
was worn. The original entry follows.

Under `--rbs sig`, a method sidecar-declared `() -> String?` stops
returning nil for its valueless-if else path on the compiled binary:
`.nil?` answers false and `compact` keeps the slot. campfire's
`body_classes` joins three such guard-if helpers, so every page the
binary serves says `<body class="sidebar admin ">` — trailing space —
where Rails (and the CRuby lane, and the binary WITHOUT the sidecars)
says `sidebar admin`. Found by the room-page gate the day it was
promoted (2026-09-01); no behavioral test can see it, because a
trailing space in `class` changes no selector. Filed with a 12-line
repro. `--spinel` is expected RED on room.html until #4250 closes —
deliberately NOT masked, the same posture #4240 held: an open defect
is not a written-down decision.

(The gate's other binary-only find the same day was ours, and is
fixed: `runtime/spinel`'s `parse_db_time` read whole seconds where the
CRuby overlay's twin reads micros, so `updated_at.to_fs(:epoch)`
answered `…000` for Rails' `…418`.)

### `SanitizeTags` is inert on the spinel binary — matz/spinel#4240 — FIXED upstream

**FIXED 2026-08-31, hours after filing** (`c178fc15`): the block was not
even the discriminator — the no-block form took the same wrong path.
Two mechanisms agreed on the wrong answer: container-read alias
promotion bound the local to a string HANDLE on the evidence that the
mutator-name table matched `replace` and the container held a string
SOMEWHERE, and the poly `replace` arm took the builtin without asking
whether a user class owns the name (the question its `pack` sibling
always asked). Verified by RUNNING the repro (both columns answer
CRuby now) and then by the gate that found it:
`scripts/campfire-compare --spinel` is **fully green** — both frames
equivalent to Rails on the compiled binary, `<script>` content pruned
exactly as Rails prunes it. The comparator's spinel lane is a real
gate from this day. The original entry follows.

`ContentFilters::SanitizeTags#apply` is `fragment.replace(selector) {
nil }`, and on the compiled binary that call NEVER REACHES
`ActionText::Fragment#replace`: `replace` is a builtin-owned name, the
fragment arrives through the filter chain's untyped slot, and spinel
routes the call to the builtin's semantics on the wrong class
(matz/spinel#4240, filed 2026-08-31 with a 20-line repro; the family of
#4205/#4218). The scanner itself is fine — the same selector and input
pass under the spinel test harness, where the receiver is typed
(`test_replace_with_campfires_own_allow_list`).

**Every probe instrumented on the way to this**: the selector was
correct (427 chars), `parse_selector` called DIRECTLY answered kind=not
with 44 exclusions, and `replace` entered for no caller — the
before/after lengths were equal on every message since the day the tree
first compiled. Plain-text bodies have nothing to strip, which is how a
dead security filter coexisted with every green gate until
`scripts/campfire-compare` diffed an HTML-bodied frame against Rails.

**Security posture, stated precisely**: no unsafe markup shipped. The
downstream safe-list sanitizer (`sanitize_allowing`, via
`SanitizeAttributes`) enforces the same tag allow-list with strip
semantics, so a `<script>` still cannot render — the divergence is that
Rails' pipeline REMOVES a disallowed element's content (`replace { nil
}` prunes children) where the binary keeps it as escaped text:
`alert(1)` visible as text where Rails shows nothing. Defense-in-depth
held; fidelity did not.

`scripts/campfire-compare --spinel` is expected RED on
`frame_html.html` until #4240 closes — deliberately not masked in the
comparator: an open defect is not a written-down decision. The ruby
lane gates green.

### A form holding a file field is not multipart

Rails' form builder flips a form to `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
the moment a `file_field` renders inside it. The emitted `<form>`
carries no enctype, so the browser posts `application/x-www-form-
urlencoded` — and a file input in a urlencoded form submits its
FILENAME as a plain string, never its bytes. campfire's join page is
the corpus case: the signup form carries an avatar picker, so a new
user who chooses an avatar posts `user[avatar]=<name>.png` and no
attachment is created. An empty picker posts an empty string, which is
why signup itself works.

Closing this needs two halves in one commit: the form lowering
emitting the enctype when a file field is in the tree, and the request
side parsing a multipart body into the same `Hash[String, ParamValue]`
shape the urlencoded parser fills — shipping the enctype alone would
turn a silently-wrong filename into a request the server cannot read
at all. Attachment upload is already outside the archive's scope (the
Active Storage tail), so this rides with that work, written down here
so the form's spelling is a decision rather than a surprise.

Found 2026-09-01 by the join-form probe that closed the view-params
symbol-key defect (the form's `action` was the visible half; the
enctype was sitting beside it).

### SQL functions an initializer registers are installed on CRuby and spinel, not JRuby

An app that registers SQLite functions in an initializer —
`raw_connection.create_function("regexp", 2) do |fn, …| … end`,
`create_aggregate("stddev", 1) do step … finalize … end`, the shape
lobsters' `config/initializers/sqlite_functions.rb` patches into the
adapter — has them read at ingest into `App::sql_functions`. Each block
body is an ordinary `SqlFunctions` class method taking the SQLite
context as its first parameter under the app's own name for it (`fn`),
so `fn.result = …` and an aggregate's `fn[:n]` state read as written;
a `next` that left the block is a `return` in the method.

Both lanes that install them generate a `sql_functions.rb` beside
`db.rb`, and `Db` calls its `install` on every pooled connection, as
Rails' adapter patch does:

- **CRuby** registers each through the sqlite3 gem; the context object
  handed in is the gem's own function proxy — the object the app's
  blocks were written against.
- **Spinel** binds SQLite through FFI (`project::spinel_sql_functions_file`):
  one `ffi_callback` trampoline per function reads the `sqlite3_value`
  arguments into the Ruby values the gem would hand the block, and a
  small `SqlFnContext` class plays the gem's proxy — `result=`, and
  `[]` / `[]=` over per-GROUP state keyed by the address
  `sqlite3_aggregate_context` returns, behind a Mutex because the OS
  workers share the process. One spinel shape is designed around, not
  hidden: an `ffi_callback` argument cannot be `nil` and a trampoline is
  typed over `const void *`, so registration goes through a six-line
  `ffi_source` adapter. The app's bodies ship as written —
  `fn[:n] ||= 0` / `fn[:n] += 1` on the context class compile since
  spinel 606acc03 (matz/spinel#5054, filed from this).

**JRuby** does not install them yet: it reaches SQLite over JDBC, whose
user-function API is `org.sqlite.Function` subclasses — a different
registration shape. Raw SQL that calls one fails with SQLite's "no such
function" there.

Lobsters reaches `stddev` from `FlaggedCommenters`, which renders on any
page where you view your own threads, profile or inbox (the 2023
ruby-bench snapshot had that warning switched off for this reason, and
registers no functions — so on spinel the snapshot keeps FlaggedCommenters'
façade, which stands aside only when the app registers both `stddev` and
`if`: `Facade::lifted_by_sql_functions`).

Found 2026-09-25 bringing current lobsters' benchmark routes up on the
ruby lane; the spinel install landed the same day.
