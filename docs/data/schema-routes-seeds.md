# Schema, routes, seeds, and importmap

A family of files under a Rails app are not treated as general code —
they're recognized as declarative inputs and ingested into dedicated
IR structures. The four covered in depth here are `db/schema.rb`,
`config/routes.rb`, `db/seeds.rb`, and `config/importmap.rb`; the
same family also takes in test fixtures (below), `db/migrate/`
migrations (below), `config/routes/` split files, and `sig/**/*.rbs`
RBS sidecars (`App::rbs_signatures`, parsed by `src/rbs.rs`). This
doc covers what each one contributes, the IR shape it produces, and
the `*_to_library` lowering pass that turns each one into a
`LibraryFunction` (or `LibraryClass` for fixtures) for the universal
post-lowering IR that emitters consume.

The pattern is consistent throughout:

```
file → dedicated IR (App::<field>) → *_to_library → LibraryFunction → emit
```

The lowered shape is the designed contract, and the preferred path is
for emitters to consume it rather than the source IR (`Schema`,
`RouteTable`, `Importmap`, `App::seeds`). Direct source-IR reads do
survive in emitters (e.g. `src/emit/typescript.rs` reads `app.schema`
directly; `src/emit/roda.rs` writes `db/migrate` files from
`Schema`) — those are candidates to migrate, not a second contract.
See [`../pipeline/lower.md`](../pipeline/lower.md) for the two-shape
contract.

## `db/schema.rb` → `Schema` → `Schema.statements`

**Source IR:** `src/schema.rs::Schema` — an `IndexMap<Symbol, Table>`.
Each `Table` carries its columns (typed via `ColumnType`), indexes,
and foreign-key declarations. Iteration order is source order, so
downstream consumers (schema DDL lowering, persistence lowering, model
attribute seeding) produce deterministic output.

**Ingest:** `src/ingest/schema.rs::ingest_schema`. Recognizes the
`ActiveRecord::Schema[…].define do` DSL: `create_table`, `t.string`,
`t.integer`, `t.references`, `t.timestamps`, `add_index`,
`add_foreign_key`, etc.

**Downstream consumers (analyze/lower):**

- **Analyzer** seeds each model's `attributes` row from its matching
  table — this is how `article.title : String` gets its type without
  any annotation in the model file.
- **`src/emit/shared/schema_sql.rs::render_schema_statements`**
  produces the `CREATE TABLE …` DDL statement list in the SQLite
  dialect, which every caller uses today (the joined-string
  `render_schema_sql` survives for some targets);
  `render_schema_statements_for(schema, Dialect::Postgres)` renders
  the same schema for Postgres (see the shape limits below). The
  sibling `src/emit/shared/seed_sql.rs` renders `db/seeds.rb` data to
  a `db/seed.sql` for text-only archives.
- **`src/lower/persistence.rs`** uses the column list to build
  INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE / SELECT strings per model.

**Lowered to LibraryFunction:** `src/lower/schema_to_library/`
produces a single `LibraryFunction` — `Schema.statements() ->
Array<Str>` under `module_path: ["Schema"]`. The body is an array
literal of the rendered DDL statements, one `Lit::Str` each. Empty
when `schema.tables` is empty (apps without persisted models don't
need a `Schema` artifact).

**Per-target emit:** TS writes `src/schema.ts` exporting
`statements`. `main.ts` passes `schemaStatements:
Schema.statements()` to the runtime's `startServer({ … })`.

**Known shape limits.** Every emitter that renders this DDL uses the
SQLite dialect. Per-engine DDL sits behind the `Dialect` enum in
`schema_sql.rs`, without changing the `Schema` IR itself (it's already
dialect-neutral) or the lowerer. `Dialect::Postgres` (stage (a) of
#91; no target emits it yet) spells column types as Rails' PostgreSQL
adapter creates them, quotes every identifier, and gives a key Rails'
default convention for its type: `bigserial`, `serial` for an
`integer` key, and `uuid … DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()` for a `uuid`
one. Neither dialect reproduces source column defaults, foreign keys
or CHECK constraints: Postgres synthesizes the key defaults above, so
a custom or suppressed one is not reproduced, and the model layer
applies supported literal defaults. A virtual table has no Postgres
DDL, so that dialect returns an error for it. Postgres renders what
ingest kept, so it shares the current ingest and IR limits.
`schema.rb` ingest drops `array: true`; an index's `using:`, `order:`
and `opclass:`, and expression indexes; precision on `numeric`,
`datetime` and `time`; a `limit:` of 1 or 2 on an `integer` column
(so no `smallint`; 5 to 8 is a `bigint`, as in Rails); and schema
qualifiers. The key forms the
PostgreSQL dumper writes are read as the keys they name: `id: :serial`
is an `integer` key, and a hash-valued `id: { type: :string, limit:
32 }` keeps its type and limit. And the folds below
apply (`jsonb` and `json` both render `jsonb`, `timestamptz` renders
`timestamp`). A partial index's predicate (`t.index … where:`,
`add_index … where:` in the migration fold, or `WHERE` in
`structure.sql`) is kept as the source database wrote it. Postgres
renders it on every index. SQLite renders it on a unique index, where
it decides which rows must be distinct, and so do the `insert_all`
conflict guard and `upsert_all`'s conflict target (`unique_by:` picks
the first unique index by name with those columns, as Rails does).
SQLite leaves it off a non-unique index, which then covers every row,
and off a unique one whose predicate falls outside the syntax both
engines read alike (`Dialect::index_predicate`: the table's columns,
literals, boolean and comparison operators, a few shared functions).
A Postgres dump's `::text` casts or `= ANY (ARRAY[…])` fall outside it;
that index is unique over every row, and the transpile names it in a
warning. The migration fold refuses to rename or remove a column a
predicate names.
Postgres column types map to their SQLite storage at
ingest (`uuid` → TEXT via `ColumnType::Uuid`, `jsonb` → json,
`citext` → text, `timestamptz` → datetime, `inet`/`cidr`/`macaddr`/
`enum` → string); a type with no mapping is an ingest error (a ledger
line under `--survey`), never a silent drop — its index would still be
emitted and the DDL would not apply. A non-integer primary key
(`create_table …, id: :uuid` / `primary_key: "identifier", id:
:string`) renders as `TEXT PRIMARY KEY` in SQLite and is carried end
to end by the ruby-shape emit: the analyzer
types `id`, `ids` and the key-taking finders from that column; the
emitted `find`/`exists?`/`update`/`delete`/`reload` primitives
compare it with the key's type; insert writes it (minting a blank
`uuid` key with `SecureRandom.uuid`, as the Postgres default would)
and answers it instead of the rowid; a key not called `id` gets
`id`/`id=` aliases; and a uuid foreign key's "no row" sentinel is
`""`, not `0`. Spinel carries it too: the shared `ActiveRecord::Base`
holds no `@id` slot (under Spinel a base-class ivar is the union of
every subclass's writes, so one String-keyed model would widen every
model's key to poly), its `id`/`id=` are a raise-bodied contract each
model's own typed accessors implement, and an app with a string key
ships the runtime sidecar with that contract widened to
`(Integer | String)` (`project::widen_key_contract`) while an
integer-only app ships it byte for byte. The compiled targets' model
layers still pin an integer id and report `non_integer_primary_key`
as an unsupported construct at emit time, per target, rather than as
an ingest gap that would be false of the ruby family (#90;
`fixtures/tiny-blog-uuid` + `tests/uuid_key_ruby.rs` run the shape
on CRuby, and the same fixture compiles and serves under Spinel).

## `config/routes.rb` → `RouteTable` → `RouteHelpers.<x>_path`

**Source IR:** `src/dialect.rs::RouteTable` — a list of `RouteSpec`
entries plus `direct_helpers` (`direct :name` custom URL helpers,
lowered by `src/lower/routes_to_library/direct.rs`). `RouteSpec` has
four variants — `Explicit`, `Root`, `Resources`, and `Scope`
(`namespace`/`scope` nesting); see `src/dialect.rs` for what each
carries (`Resources` knows about singular `resource` and `as:`
renames; `Explicit` records its `member`/`collection` scope).

**Ingest:** `src/ingest/routes.rs::ingest_routes`. Finds the outer
`Rails.application.routes.draw do … end` and walks its statements.
The recognizer covers the verb shortcuts (`get`/`post`/…), `match`,
`root`, `resources`/`resource` (with `only:`/`except:`/`as:`/
`controller:`/`param:`/`path:`, symbol or string spellings alike, as Rails
`to_sym`s them), `namespace`/`scope`,
`member`/`collection`/`constraints` blocks, `mount`, `draw(:name)`
split files under `config/routes/`, and options like `defaults:`,
`on:`, and `via:` — `src/ingest/routes.rs` is the authority on the
current surface. A `redirect(...)` target — on a verb or on `root` —
is not modeled: the route is dropped with a `route dropped:` ledger
line, the same contract as `mount`.

**Downstream consumers (analyze/lower):**

- **Analyzer** uses the controller/action pairings to wire up before-
  action and render edges.
- **`src/lower/routes.rs::flatten_routes`** expands the source-shape
  `RouteTable` into a flat `Vec<FlatRoute>`: one entry per
  `(method, path, controller, action)`, with `namespace`/`scope`
  prefixes composed in, a helper name (`article` → `article_path`,
  `edit_article` → `edit_article_path`), and the ordered list of path
  parameter names. `FlatRoute` also records whether the route is
  named (unnamed dynamic routes get no helper) and any route-forced
  response format.

**Lowered to LibraryFunction:** `src/lower/routes_to_library/`
produces one `LibraryFunction` per named route under `module_path:
["RouteHelpers"]`. Body is a typed `StringInterp` building the path
from path-params (`id` and `<x>_id` typed as `Int`, others as `Str`).
Multiple HTTP verbs on the same path collapse to a single helper
(e.g. `articles_path` covers both `GET /articles` and `POST
/articles`).

Route helpers are only half of what `src/lower/routes_to_library/`
emits: `lower_routes_to_dispatch_functions` builds the dispatch
surface under `module_path: ["RouteTable"]` (emitted to
`app/routes.ts` on TS) — the table that makes requests reach
controllers — and `lower_url_option_helpers` adds resolvers for
hash-form `url_for` options.

**Per-target emit:** TS writes `app/route_helpers.ts` with one
`export function` per helper plus the namespace const. Controller
and view bodies that call `RouteHelpers.article_path(id)` resolve
through the namespace import unchanged.

**Known shape limits.** Custom routes with `constraints:` are
preserved in the IR but the helper-emit ignores them.

## `db/seeds.rb` → `App::seeds` → `Seeds.run`

**Source IR:** `src/app.rs::App::seeds: Option<Expr>` — the seeds
file is stored as a single top-level `Expr` (usually a `Seq` of
AR-create sends, frequently guarded by an early-return on "already
populated"). No special dialect wrapping; it's just Ruby in IR form.

**Ingest:** `ingest_ruby_program` on the source.

**Analyze:** the body is typed against the model registry exactly
as any controller body — `Article.create!(...)` binds its argument
types from the `Article` class's attribute row.

**Lowered to LibraryFunction:** `src/lower/seeds_to_library/`
produces one `LibraryFunction` — `Seeds.run() -> nil` under
`module_path: ["Seeds"]`. The body is the seeds Expr verbatim;
analyze has already attached types and effects, so the walker
emits `Article.create!(...)` etc. the same way it would in any
other class context.

**Per-target emit:** TS writes `db/seeds.ts` with `export function
run()` plus the namespace const. `main.ts` passes `() =>
Seeds.run()` as the `seeds` callback to `startServer({ … })`; the
runtime invokes it on first boot when the DB is empty.

**Known shape limits.** No special handling today for `Rails.env`
gates or `unless` guards on seed records — whatever Ruby the file
contains is ingested as-is and the analyzer sorts out the types.

## `config/importmap.rb` → `Importmap` → `Importmap.{pins, entry}`

**Source IR:** `src/app.rs::App::importmap: Option<Importmap>` — a
list of `ImportmapPin { name, path }` in declaration order (Rails
preserves order for modulepreload link emission).

**Ingest:** `src/ingest/app.rs::ingest_importmap`. The DSL has three
common shapes: `pin "<name>"`, `pin "<name>", to: "<path>"`, and
`pin_all_from "<dir>", under: "<prefix>"` (which expands by walking
the named directory).

**Lowered to LibraryFunction:** `src/lower/importmap_to_library/`
produces two `LibraryFunction`s under `module_path: ["Importmap"]`:
`pins()` returns the structured pin list (an `Array` of
`Record{name, path}`), and `entry()` returns the name of the
importmap's entry module. The `<script type="importmap">…</script>`
element that Rails' view layer emits via `javascript_importmap_tags`
is built by the view-helper lowering, which consumes
`pins()`/`entry()` (see `src/lower/view_to_library/helpers.rs`).

**Per-target emit:** TS writes `app/importmap.ts` with one `export
function` per method plus the namespace const; the lowered layout
view reaches them through the `javascript_importmap_tags` helper.

**Known shape limits.** `pin_all_from` walks the local file system
at ingest time; if the source moves files between ingest and emit,
the resolved pins go stale. Today the ingest+emit cycle runs in
one process so this isn't an issue.

## What about migrations?

`db/schema.rb` is canonical whenever it exists, because:

1. `schema.rb` is the denormalized, authoritative snapshot — the same
   view every `rails db:prepare` would construct.
2. Migrations are imperative; schema.rb is declarative. Typing against
   the final shape is straightforward; replaying migrations to derive
   it is avoidable work.

When `schema.rb` is absent, Roundhouse next reads `db/structure.sql`
(`src/ingest/structure_sql.rs`), the SQL dump Rails writes under
`config.active_record.schema_format = :sql`. Its reader handles
PostgreSQL's `pg_dump` format. It skips the `\restrict` and
`\unrestrict` lines that pg_dump 18 (and the August 2025 minor
releases) brackets a dump with and that Rails before 7.2.3/8.0.3 keeps;
any other psql meta-command is ledgered as a statement it does not
model. When there is neither (never migrated locally, or gitignored),
the walk falls back to folding `db/migrate/*.rb` in filename order —
`src/ingest/schema.rs::ingest_migration`, called from
`src/ingest/app.rs`. Migration shapes it can't fold deterministically
(see `UNSUPPORTED_VERBS`) error with a pointer to `rails db:migrate`,
which materializes the schema.rb this fallback substitutes for. Roda
apps get the same fallback for Sequel-DSL migrations via
`src/ingest/sequel_migration.rs`.

The real-blog fixture generator (`scripts/create-blog`) runs
`rails db:prepare` after generating migrations, so `schema.rb`
always exists by the time ingest runs. See
[fixture setup](../development/testing.md#fixtures).

## Test fixtures: `test/fixtures/*.yml`

Not under `db/` or `config/`, but worth naming here since it rounds
out the declarative-inputs picture. Each `<table>.yml` becomes a
`Fixture` entry in `App::fixtures`; `src/lower/fixtures.rs::lower_fixtures`
turns them into a per-target-renderable load plan (which columns
receive literals, which are foreign-key references to another
fixture's eventual AUTOINCREMENT rowid). Record values are held as
`FixtureValue::Scalar(String)` or `FixtureValue::Ruby(Expr)` for
inline `<%= … %>` values, and a fixture file's ERB statement tags
land in the fixture's `preamble` of ingested Ruby (`src/dialect.rs`,
`src/ingest/fixture.rs`); emitters coerce scalars per column type.

**Lowered to LibraryClass** (not LibraryFunction — fixtures are
class-shaped because they have a state-like notion of "the loaded
records by label"). `src/lower/fixture_to_library/` produces one
`LibraryClass` per fixture file: `<Plural>Fixtures` with one class
method per label (`articles(:one)` → `ArticlesFixtures.one()`).

**Per-target emit:** TS writes `test/fixtures/<plural>.ts` with one
`export class <Plural>Fixtures` declaring all the labeled record
methods.
