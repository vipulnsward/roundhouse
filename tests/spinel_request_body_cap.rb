# Driver for tests/spinel_request_body_cap.rs — the request-body cap in
# the spinel lane's HTTP server (`runtime/spinel/tep/`).
#
# Run under plain CRuby against the real servers over a scripted socket
# (tests/tep_server_harness.rb).
#
# Headers were capped (MAX_REQUEST_BYTES, 64 KiB) but the body was not:
# `Request#content_length` was the header's bare `.to_i`, and every drain
# looped recv-and-append until that many bytes had arrived. A client could
# declare `Content-Length: 10737418240` and stream, and the worker held
# all of it in one String (rebuilt by `+` on every chunk) before the app
# ever saw the request. A body that large must be refused from the
# header — 413, before a single body byte is read — and a Content-Length
# that is not a plain decimal byte count is a 400, as Puma (the Rails
# lane's server) answers it, rather than whatever `.to_i` makes of it.
