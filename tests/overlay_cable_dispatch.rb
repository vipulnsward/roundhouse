# Named-channel subscribe dispatch on the CRuby overlay, exercised.
#
# Loads the overlay files directly — no emit, no server, no socket:
# `ruby tests/overlay_cable_dispatch.rb .` reproduces it by hand.
#
# WHAT IS UNDER TEST is the authorization decision, not the plumbing.
# `Cable::Dispatch.subscribe` resolves the channel a client NAMED,
# instantiates it, and runs the app's own `subscribed`; the reactor and
# the worker pool exist only to decide which thread that happens on.
# Keeping the decision in a plain module is what lets this file drive it
# with neither nio4r nor websocket-driver installed — the same
# constraint `overlay_cable_identity.rb` documents, and the same
# stubbing.
#
# The channels below are campfire's EMITTED forms, copied from
# `app/models/room_messages_channel.rb` in the transpiled tree rather
# than from campfire's source. That is deliberate and it is the point of
# the test: the emit is what runs, and its `ActiveSupport.present?` /
# `self.class.subscribable_room` spellings are what the runtime has to
# satisfy.
