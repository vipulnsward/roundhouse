//! Engine-parameterized view-ingest harness.
//!
//! The shared gate for the text-template engine family (ERB today; HAML
//! and herb as they land). Every engine compiles its template text to the
//! same `_buf`-append Ruby shape + segment map and flows through the one
//! `ingest_template` pipeline, so the invariants below are engine-agnostic
//! and parameterized over the engine table from day one: adding HAML/herb
//! is a new `Case` row, not a new harness.
//!
//! What this covers now (in-process, no toolchain): the compile contract
//! (the `_buf` prologue/epilogue shape) and the ingest contract (name/
//! format parsing + spans translated into template coordinates).
//!
//! What it deliberately does NOT cover yet: the byte-identical HTML
//! differential against each engine's *reference* renderer (erubi /
//! `haml` gem / herb). That needs emit + a CRuby render and is only
//! meaningful once a second engine exists to disagree, so it attaches
//! per-engine in the #59 (HAML) / #60 (herb) conformance step — reusing
//! this same `Case` table as its fixtures.
