//! Every `Db` shim implements the same contract.
//!
//! The primitive `Db` surface is hand-written once per target (the
//! lower half of the two-layer runtime), and the lowerer emits calls
//! against it blind — nothing at emit time proves the method it calls
//! actually exists in the shim it will run on. A missing method is a
//! per-target build or runtime failure, discovered only when that
//! lane's toolchain job runs.
//!
//! That is how the nullable-column seam (`*_opt`) shipped half-done:
//! TypeScript has FOUR shims and only one of them got the new methods,
//! which surfaced as `Property 'column_text_opt' does not exist` in CI
//! two cycles later. This test enumerates the implementations in ONE
//! place so adding a method to the contract means adding it everywhere
//! or explaining why not.
//!
//! Naming: each target renames on its own convention (Go prefixes
//! `Db_`, Swift/Kotlin camelCase, C# PascalCase) and Ruby's `?` suffix
//! is unspellable outside the Ruby family, so predicates carry a
//! per-target spelling. Both live in the tables below — the contract
//! itself stays in canonical snake_case.
