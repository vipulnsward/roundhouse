//! A model CLASS METHOD reached through an association takes that
//! association's relation as its scope (`scope_chain::AssocClassMethods`).
//!
//! Rails runs `user.sessions.start!(…)` and `@room.notes.paged?` with
//! the association as the current scope. The method gains a trailing
//! `__rel`, the call site passes the seed, and the body reads it in one
//! of two ways:
//!
//!   * a CONSTRUCTOR merges `__rel.scope_attributes` UNDER its own
//!     attributes (Rails assigns explicit ones after the scope's, so an
//!     explicit value wins) — which is how `scope_for_create` gets
//!     `user_id` onto the row without anybody naming the column;
//!   * a QUERY roots on `__rel` exactly as a scope body does — so
//!     `paged?`'s bare `count` counts THIS room's notes.
//!
//! Our association reader is arel-folded to an Array, so neither call
//! resolves at all today.
//!
//! Demand-gated: only a method some call site actually reaches through
//! an association grows the parameter, so an app that never writes the
//! shape emits exactly what it emitted before.
