# Loads the overlay files directly, in boot.rb's order — no emit, no
# server: `ruby tests/overlay_cable_identity.rb .` reproduces it by hand.
#
# The app connection below is campfire's `app/channels/application_cable/
# connection.rb` AS EMITTED, plus the `Authentication::SessionLookup` it
# includes. That is the point of the test: `Cable.identify` must work by
# RUNNING THE APP'S `connect`, so the fixture has to be the app's code
# rather than a restatement of what the runtime happens to do — and it
# has to be the code that actually reaches the tree, which is not quite
# the source (see the note above the class).
