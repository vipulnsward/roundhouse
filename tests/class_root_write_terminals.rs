//! `<Model>.destroy_by(…)` / `.delete_by(…)` seed a Relation
//! (`scope_chain::CLASS_ROOT_TERMINALS`).
//!
//! Rails delegates every terminal from a model class to `all`. Here only
//! the ones that have no other home do that, because the arel pass owns
//! `count` / `exists?` / `find_by` / `all` at a Const root and re-rooting
//! those would move work out from under it (`Comment.count` is an
//! inlined `SELECT COUNT(*)`, not a Relation).
//!
//! `destroy_by` and `delete_by` have no such home: both are `where` plus
//! a write, `Base` defines neither, and the arel pass claims neither —
//! so campfire's `Push::Subscription.destroy_by(endpoint:, user_id:)`
//! reached NOTHING, with the analyzer saying so out loud
//! (`send_dispatch_failed: no known method `destroy_by` on
//! Class { Push::Subscription }`).
//!
//! The KWARGS form is split earlier, by `lower::destroy_by`, into the
//! `where` + `destroy_all` / `delete_all` pair Rails defines it as. The
//! whole-app gate now recognizes that class-root `where`, so scope-free
//! apps explicitly seed it with `ActiveRecord::Relation.new(...)`. Other
//! argument shapes retain the original terminal and receive the same
//! explicit Relation seed.
//!
//! Both the whole-app gate and the per-body gate use
//! `mentions_model_chain_start`: a class-root query or write terminal
//! must reach the rewriter even when no named scope is declared.
