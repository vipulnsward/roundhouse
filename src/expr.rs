//! The language-core expression IR: `Expr` (span, inferred type,

//! Ruby's ~80 Prism node kinds collapse into. Ingest builds these
//! bare; analyze stamps `ty` and `effects`; lowerers rewrite trees
//! and tag `IrHint`s; every emitter walks the result. The
//! surface-preservation fields (`ArrayStyle`, `BlockStyle`,
//! `parenthesized`, `leading_blank_line`) carry the author's spelling
//! so ingest → emit-ruby reproduces the source — the discipline
//! `roundhouse-ast --round-trip` checks. `PartialEq` deliberately
