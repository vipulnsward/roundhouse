//! Method catalog — the IDL-shaped single source of truth for what
//! the compiler knows about framework and runtime method surfaces.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! Before the catalog, knowledge about ActiveRecord methods was
//! scattered across five places: `SqliteAdapter.classify_ar_method`
//! (effect classification), `Analyzer::new` class_methods HashMap
//! (return types), `lower::controller::is_query_builder_method`
//! (chain classification), hand-coded emitter templates (emission
//! shapes), and per-target runtime stubs (actual implementations).
//! Adding a new AR method meant editing N places, and drift was
//! inevitable.
//!
//! The catalog is the authoritative declarative record. Each entry
//! captures the facets every consumer needs: identity (name +
//! receiver context), side-effect class, chain semantics (for
//! terminal-vs-builder distinction), and — growing over time —
//! return-type signature, capability gate, per-target runtime
//! symbol maps.
//!
//! ## What this is not
//!
//! - Not an external DSL today. Entries live as Rust code (static
//!   table). If/when externalization is needed (gem-author RBS,
//!   user annotations), a parser will populate the same
//!   `CatalogedMethod` struct.
//! - Not a type system. The analyzer still owns type inference; the
//!   catalog just declares what's available for dispatch.
//! - Not a capability profile. Adapters declare *which* catalog
//!   entries they support; the catalog itself is adapter-neutral.
//!
//! ## What's in the minimum viable version
//!
//! AR methods only. The catalog will grow to include view helpers
//! (`form_with`, `link_to`, `render`), controller helpers (`render`,
//! `redirect_to`, `head`), and route DSL over time — but today's
//! scope is the AR method surface the compiler recognizes.
//!
//! Return types are the `return_kind` facet (`ReturnKind`), keyed to
//! the receiver context — in `Relation` context, `Self` means the
//! relation's element model. See `ReceiverContext` below.
