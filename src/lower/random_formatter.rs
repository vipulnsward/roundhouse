//! `Random.uuid` → `SecureRandom.uuid`, and the rest of the
//! `Random::Formatter` surface with it.
//!
//! These are not two methods that happen to agree. `securerandom.rb`
//! defines ONE module, `Random::Formatter`, and extends BOTH `Random`
//! and `SecureRandom` with it; `uuid` is the same code either way, and
//! only the byte source underneath differs — `Random`'s default PRNG
//! (Mersenne Twister) versus the OS CSPRNG. Which is also why
//! `Random.uuid` is undefined until something requires securerandom:
//! campfire's `Message#client_message_id ||= Random.uuid` works only
//! because Rails has already required it.
//!
//! Nothing on any target defines it. `SecureRandom` is the name the
//! emitted tree already carries (campfire reaches it four other ways,
//! `SecureRandom.alphanumeric` among them), so grounding here spends no
//! new runtime surface — the same reasoning as `time_current`.
//!
//! **Divergence, deliberately in the safe direction:** the rewritten
//! call reads the CSPRNG where Rails read the PRNG. The value is a v4
//! UUID string either way and every consumer treats it as an opaque id;
//! an app that wanted a *reproducible* uuid from a seeded `Random`
//! would not get one, and no corpus app asks for that. Recorded in
//! docs/pipeline/runtime.md.
//!
//! Only the names `Random` cannot answer on its own are rewritten.
//! `Random.rand`, `Random.bytes`, `Random.new_seed`, `Random.srand`
//! and `Random.random_number` are real methods on the PRNG class with
//! their own meaning, and redirecting those WOULD change behavior.
