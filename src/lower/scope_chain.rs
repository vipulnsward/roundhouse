//! Scope-call normalization — the lowering that lets ActiveRecord scope
//! chains run against the metaprogramming-free `ActiveRecord::Relation`
//! runtime (see project_lobsters_benchmark_parity_plan).
//!
//! A model `scope :name, ->(args){ body }` lowers (in `push_scope_methods`)
//! to a class method `def self.name(args, _rel = ActiveRecord::Relation.new(self))`.
//! For `Story.base(u).positive_ranked` to work without `method_missing`,
//! every scope INVOCATION is rewritten so the scope is an ordinary class
//! method taking the current relation as a trailing argument:
//!
//!   recv.scope(args)        (recv is a relation)  ->  Model.scope(args, recv)
//!   Model.scope(args)       (call on the class)   ->  Model.scope(args)   [default rel]
//!   <implicit>.scope(args)  (inside a scope body) ->  Model.scope(args, _rel)
//!
//! Relation built-ins (`where`/`order`/`limit`/…) stay `recv.method(args)`;
//! a `Model.where(...)` / `Model.all` chain-start (no scope) is seeded with
//! `ActiveRecord::Relation.new(Model)` so it, too, is chainable.

/// read. campfire's `memberships.destroy_by user: users` is the caller
/// that showed the gate was narrower than its own reasoning.
/// Does this body park an association read on a name and then chain

/// be one expression.
///
/// Two passes, because one would have to guess: collect the names bound
