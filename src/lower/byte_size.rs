//! ActiveSupport byte-size helpers → the multiplication they are.
//!
//! `5.megabytes` → `5 * 1048576`. Unlike the sibling DURATION helpers
//! (`60.seconds`), which Rails answers with an `ActiveSupport::Duration`
//! value object that the runtime has to model, `Numeric#megabytes` is
//! defined as literally `self * 1024 * 1024` — the result is an ordinary
//! Integer (or Float, for a Float receiver) with no wrapper and no unit
//! memory. So the grounded form is the arithmetic itself, and no
//! runtime support is needed on any target.
//!
//! Two things this buys beyond "it stops raising NoMethodError on a
//! target without ActiveSupport":
//!
//! - The site types `Int` instead of `Ty::Untyped`
//!   (`analyze::body::send::int_method` files these under "a
//!   Numeric-ish value we don't model structurally"), so every
//!   downstream consumer of the value keeps a real type. That matters
//!   most for the strict targets, which cannot emit an untyped slot.
//! - It reaches CLASS-BODY CONSTANTS, which is where the corpus
//!   actually writes them (`Opengraph::Fetch::MAX_BODY_SIZE =
//!   5.megabytes`) — load-time code, so an ungrounded send there kills
//!   the process at `require`, not at first call.
//!
//! ONE AMBIGUITY, and it is the reason this checks the receiver type:
//! `bytes` is also `String#bytes`, which answers an Array of byte
//! values — a completely different meaning on a receiver the corpus
//! also holds. A receiver whose type we cannot see is left alone rather
//! than guessed at; a missed fold degrades to the status quo, a wrong
//! one silently turns a byte array into a number.
