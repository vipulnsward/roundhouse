//! `Model.destroy_by(col: value)` → `Model.where(col: value).destroy_all`,
//! and `delete_by` → `delete_all` beside it.
//!
//! That rewrite is Rails' own definition of the method, which is a
//! one-liner over `where`; nothing about it is specific to a target.
//! Writing it here rather than as a `Base` runtime method is the
//! difference between one shared lowering and nine primitives: a method
//! defined on `Base` is a method on EVERY model in EVERY target, and
//! the last attempt at that reddened two CI jobs because the strict
//! targets have to give the conditions parameter a type, and a
//! conditions hash is a different shape at every call site.
//!
//! Runs beside `exists_conditions`, which splits `exists?` the same way
//! and for the same reason, and shares its two outcomes: literal
//! conditions get folded into one statement by the arel rewrite, a
//! runtime value falls to the Relation.
//!
//! Rails accepts the id/positional forms of `exists?` but `destroy_by`
//! takes conditions only, so the kwargs guard here is about what the
//! synthesized `where` can carry, not about telling two methods apart.
//! The other shapes `where` accepts (a String fragment, a positional
//! hash) keep the Relation seed `scope_chain::CLASS_ROOT_TERMINALS`
//! gives them, and so does the association-receiver form
//! (`room.memberships.destroy_by user: users`) — an association read is
//! Array-typed, not Relation-typed, so it never reaches this pass.
