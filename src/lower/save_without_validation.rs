//! `record.save(validate: false)` / `record.save!(validate: false)` →
//! `record.save_after_validation`.
//!
//! Rails' `validate: false` skips validations and their callbacks and
//! runs the save callbacks — which is exactly the post-validation half
//! of the runtime's `save`, already extracted as
//! `save_after_validation` for `update_attribute` and the has_many
//! `grant_to` expansion to enter. The kwarg is the same entry point
//! spelled at the call site.
//!
//! The runtime's `save` and `save!` take no arguments, and that is
//! right for every other caller: a kwarg on a zero-arity method is an
//! ArgumentError under CRuby and, on spinel, silently dropped
//! (matz/spinel#4436) — which VALIDATED the row the caller was planting
//! precisely because it would not validate. campfire's
//! push_subscriptions test does that to seed a legacy row
//! (`legacy.save!(validate: false)`) and then asserts the re-POST is
//! rejected; the seed itself was rejected first.
//!
//! The bang form loses nothing: `save!(validate: false)` cannot raise
//! `RecordInvalid` (nothing validated), and the runtime's
//! `save_after_validation` has no abortable callbacks to turn into
//! `RecordNotSaved`. A `validate: true` — Rails' default, written out —
//! is left as the plain call it means. Any other kwarg is not this
//! pass's to read.
//!
//! Shape-directed, not type-directed: `save(validate: false)` names no
//! method but ActiveRecord's, so the receiver's type adds nothing the
//! spelling has not already said.
