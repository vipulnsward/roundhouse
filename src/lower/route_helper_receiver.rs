//! A bare `<x>_path` in a LIBRARY CLASS or a VIEW gets its
//! `RouteHelpers.` receiver, the same one controllers and tests get.
//!
//! `controller_to_library`'s `rewrite_route_helpers` has qualified
//! controller and test bodies for a long time, and view lowering
//! qualifies the URL ARGUMENT of `link_to` / `form_with`. Nothing
//! qualified anywhere else, so campfire emitted the same helper spelled
//! two ways in one tree: `RouteHelpers.rails_blob_path(...)` on
//! `_actions.html.erb:33`, where it is `link_to`'s first argument, and a
//! bare `rails_blob_path(...)` five lines later, where it is a `data:`
//! hash value. `app/helpers/messages/attachment_presentation.rb` —
//! `delegate :rails_blob_path, to: :context` in Rails, a library class
//! here — emitted two more. Three calls to a method the emitted tree
//! does not define, and the spinel build stops at the first one.
//!
//! **The rule is "a name `RouteHelpers` ANSWERS", not the `_path`
//! suffix, and reusing `rewrite_route_helpers` to get the suffix rule
//! was measurably wrong.** That was the first attempt and it regressed
//! five sites in one emit, three ways at once:
//!
//! * It folds `_url` onto its `_path` twin. A later pass turns
//!   `new_session_url` into `"#{Rails.application.protocol}#{Rails.application.domain}#{…}"`;
//!   folding first left campfire's post-authentication redirect pointing
//!   at a bare path with no host.
//! * The suffix caught `image_path`, `asset_path` and `polymorphic_url`,
//!   which are `ActionView::ViewHelpers`' business — a later pass
//!   qualifies them there, and this one got to them first.
//! * It strips a `Rails.application.routes.url_helpers` receiver up
//!   front and re-adds `RouteHelpers.` after. With a shadow set in play
//!   the second half declines and the first half has already happened:
//!   `Webhook#room_bot_messages_path`, whose body calls the route helper
//!   of the very same name through `url_helpers`, came out bare.
//!
//! So the name set is the app's own route table (the `_path` spellings
//! — `RouteHelpers` emits no `_url` form) plus the engine-mounted
//! helpers the runtime stubs. `rails_blob_path` is why that second half
//! exists: Active Storage is a MOUNTED ENGINE, so it appears in no app
//! route table, and the only thing that answers it is
//! `runtime/ruby/active_storage.rb`.
//!
//! **The SHADOW set is what makes even that safe, and the corpus proves
//! it.** `Webhook` defines `message_path` and `room_bot_messages_path`,
//! colliding head-on with real route helpers of the same name and
//! forwarding to them under different arities;
//! `Messages::AttachmentPresentation` calls `rails_blob_path`, which it
//! does not define, from inside `download_url`, which it does. So the
//! shadow set is per-owner: a class's own methods, its parent's, and its
//! included modules'. A view's is every `_path`/`_url` a helper MODULE
//! defines, which is Rails' view scope.
//!
//! No `.id` projection here, deliberately. `rewrite_route_helpers` does
//! it for controllers off a segment-shape table; no library class in the
//! corpus hands a record to a route helper, and a site that starts to
//! will pass a record where the helper's signature says `Integer` — a
//! type error the ledger reports, which beats a silent guess
//! ([[project_lobsters_story_route_kwargs_poly_receiver]]).
//!
//! **WHERE it runs is a constraint, not a preference.** Every route
//! helper receiver in the emit is added at EMIT time — controllers get
//! theirs in `controller_to_library`, views in `emit_lowered_views` —
//! and that is because `lower_routes_to_library_functions` SURVEYS the
//! app IR for bare `<x>_path` sends first, to decide each generated
//! helper's segment types and query keys. Run this at app-lowering
//! time instead and the survey stops seeing the call: campfire's
//! `qr_code_path` lost the String-typed segment it had been given, and
//! `room_involvement_path` lost its `involvement:` query parameter
//! entirely. So this runs beside `apply_helper_lowering`, which is the
//! same reason that pass runs where it does.
