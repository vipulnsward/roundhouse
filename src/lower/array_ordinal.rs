//! ActiveSupport's `Array#second` … `#fifth` → an index read.
//!
//! Rails ships these by reopening `Array`, which is a shape only the
//! CRuby overlay can host: the transpiled runtimes cannot reopen a
//! builtin, and spinel AOT cannot dispatch a user-defined method on
//! one. Each is defined as exactly one index read — activesupport's
//! `array/access.rb` is `def second; self[1]; end` — so the rewrite is
//! the definition, not an approximation, and the receiver is evaluated
//! once either way.
//!
//! campfire's `RoomMessagesChannel.guarded_stream?` is
//! `stream_name.to_s.split(":", 2).second == STREAM_SUFFIX`, and it is
//! the FIRST thing `RoomStreamsAreAuthorized` calls on a cable
//! subscribe. Un-lowered it reached the spinel binary as a dynamic
//! dispatch and answered `undefined method 'second' for an instance of
//! Array` — which, on a target where an unhandled error in a request
//! ends the process, took the server down on the first subscribe
//! rather than failing one subscription.
//!
//! ONLY A TYPED ARRAY RECEIVER. `second` also exists on
//! `ActiveRecord::Relation`, where it is `offset(1).first` — a query,
//! not an index read — and the runtime answers that one with a real
//! method and a real signature. An untyped receiver is left alone for
//! the same reason: a rewrite is only sound if the receiver is known
//! to be the Array whose definition is being inlined.
