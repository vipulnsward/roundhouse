//! `GlobalID::Locator.locate(gid, only: Room)` → `locate_room(gid)`.
//!
//! `only:` is not a filter here, it is THE FINDER. globalid's own
//! `locate` constantizes the model name off the wire and finds on the
//! result; this pipeline will not emit a constant computed from a wire
//! string (and would not want to — a crafted name reaches any class),
//! so `runtime/global_id_locator.rb` narrows the API to "find on the
//! class the CALLER named" and checks the URI's name against it.
//!
//! That leaves a class OBJECT as the receiver of `.find` and `.name`.
//! CRuby dispatches through the singleton; a strict target has no
//! singleton to dispatch through, and spinel emits a call to a class
//! method `ActiveRecord::Base` never defines:
//!
//! ```text
//! call to undeclared function 'sp_ActiveRecord__Base_s_find'
//! ```
//!
//! Filed as matz/spinel#4217 for the compiler half (a class-value
//! dispatch that drops its class token), but the shape is ours to
//! avoid: `only:` is a LITERAL class at every call site in the corpus,
//! so there is nothing to dispatch on. Each site is rewritten to a
//! per-model entry point and `project::apply_global_id_locate` writes
//! that entry point with the finder spelled as a literal constant —
//! the same monomorphize-because-the-set-is-closed answer
//! [[project_class_side_new_binds_lexically]] took for a class-side
//! bare `new`.
//!
//! ONLY A LITERAL `only:` IS REWRITTEN. A computed one would need the
//! dispatch this pass exists to remove; it is left alone, so it still
//! reaches the generic `locate` — which runs correctly on the Ruby
//! lanes and is refused at compile time on a strict one. A refusal
//! naming the real construct beats a silent rewrite that finds on the
//! wrong class.
//!
//! Runs on BOTH Ruby-lane and strict-target emits, deliberately: the
//! overlay and the spinel binary share `runtime/global_id_locator.rb`,
//! and a rewrite that fired on only one lane would put a different
//! authorization path in each — the divergence class
//! `scripts/campfire-cable-walk` exists to catch.
