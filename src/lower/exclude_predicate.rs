//! ActiveSupport's `Enumerable#exclude?` → `!<recv>.include?(arg)`.
//!
//! `exclude?` is a core_ext reopen whose entire body is `!include?(x)`
//! — the same shape as the `blank?` family beside this file, and it
//! reaches the same wall: no transpiled runtime can reopen the builtin,
//! and spinel AOT refuses the call outright once the receiver has a
//! static type (`unsupported call: exclude?`).
//!
//! Unlike `blank?` this needs no per-type grounding. `blank?` means
//! different things to a String, an Array and a Time, so that pass has
//! to switch on the receiver's type and warn where it can't. `exclude?`
//! is the exact negation of `include?` for every receiver AS defines it
//! on, so the rewrite is unconditional and total — which also means it
//! grounds untyped receivers the blank pass has to leave alone.
//!
//! The one thing that can make it wrong is an app defining its own
//! `exclude?`, so the pass disables itself wholesale if any app class
//! does. That is deliberately coarser than the blank pass's per-class
//! check: `exclude?` sites are overwhelmingly on collections rather
//! than on `self`, so a receiver type rarely names the defining class,
//! and a global opt-out is the honest reading of "this app means
//! something else by that name".
//!
//! Views ARE walked here, unlike the blank pass. Its exclusion exists
//! because the per-target view-cond predicate rewrites match the
//! original `blank?`/`present?` shapes and would miss a rewritten one;
//! no such machinery keys on `exclude?`, and lobsters' only view site
//! (`_threads`: `@read_by_notifications.exclude?(comment.id)`) is a
//! compile stop as soon as the local is typed.
