//! `<hash-or-array>.to_json` → `JSON.generate(<hash-or-array>)`.
//!
//! `Hash#to_json` is a core_ext reopen — Ruby's json library adds it,
//! ActiveSupport replaces it — and a reopened builtin is the one shape
//! no strict target can host and spinel cannot dispatch on. The value
//! it produces has a home already: the bundled JSON package every
//! emitted tree requires through `runtime/json_impl.rb`, whose
//! `generate` takes the same collection and answers the same String.
//! Same move as `parameterize` → `Inflector.parameterize`, and it
//! spends no new runtime surface.
//!
//! campfire's `Webhook#payload` builds a nested Hash and ends
//! `}.to_json`, which is the whole request body a bot receives — an
//! unresolved call there is not a late NoMethodError on some route, it
//! is every webhook delivery.
//!
//! GATE: a receiver the analyzer typed `Ty::Hash` or `Ty::Array`. Those
//! are exactly what `JSON.generate` serializes directly. A MODEL
//! receiver is deliberately excluded — `record.to_json` is Rails'
//! `as_json`-then-encode, which the `as_json_*` passes own and which
//! answers a different string (the model's declared shape, not its
//! ivars) — and so is an untyped one, where the receiver could be
//! anything and the rewrite would be a guess.
//!
//! DIVERGENCE: ActiveSupport's `to_json` walks `as_json` first, so a
//! Time value renders in Rails' ISO-8601 form where `JSON.generate`
//! would refuse it. The corpus receiver holds strings, integers and
//! nested hashes of the same, and a value JSON cannot encode raises
//! rather than rendering wrongly. Recorded in docs/pipeline/runtime.md.
