//! `pluck` on rows the pipeline already materialized.
//!
//! `pluck(:col)` is a Relation terminal: Rails turns it into
//! `SELECT col FROM …` and answers an Array of that column's values.
//! Two roots reach that treatment here — a model CONST
//! (`Rooms::Open.pluck(:id)`, seeded onto a Relation by
//! `lower::scope_chain`) and a Const-rooted chain
//! (`Room.where(…).pluck(:id)`, folded to SQL by `lower::arel`).
//!
//! AN ASSOCIATION READER IS NEITHER, and campfire has one:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! room.memberships.pluck(:user_id).each { |id| ... }   # Message::Broadcasts
//! ```
//!
//! `Room#memberships` is a lowered reader that answers a hydrated
//! `Array[Membership]`, and `Array` has no `pluck` — `undefined method
//! 'pluck' for an instance of Array`, a 500 on every `POST
//! /rooms/:id/messages` in a served app. (The broadcast is not lost: the
//! `after_create_commit` that fans the turbo-stream out runs before this
//! line, so the message reaches subscribers and the request that made it
//! then fails. The suite never sees it — under the test adapter the job
//! that reaches this line is enqueued rather than run.)
//!
//! So: expand it into the projection it is.
//!
//! ```ruby
//! room.memberships.map { |__pluck| __pluck.user_id }
//! ```
//!
//! WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not the SQL that Rails writes. Lifting an
//! association-rooted chain into a `SELECT user_id FROM memberships
//! WHERE room_id = ?` is the association-proxy work that
//! `project_relation_specialization_design_call` already scopes, and
//! this pass is deliberately not a down payment on it — a half-built
//! chain root that handles `pluck` and nothing else is worse than none,
//! because the next terminal to arrive looks supported until it is not.
//!
//! WHAT IT COSTS is therefore honest and small: the reader hydrates
//! every row of the association, which is what it ALREADY does today —
//! the projection is the only new work. Rails reads one column; we read
//! the row and then take the column. Ledgered.
//!
//! THE GUARD IS THE ASSOCIATION KIND, and it took two wrong answers to
//! get there. A plain `has_many` reader hydrates and answers an Array;
//! a `has_many :through` answers an `ActiveRecord::Relation` over a
//! joins chain, which HAS `pluck` and whose `pluck` is a single-column
//! SELECT. Both are spelled `owner.name`.
//!
//! * NOT the chain's innermost receiver. `Current.user.rooms.directs`
//!   bottoms out at a `Const` and is nothing to do with arel.
//! * NOT `Ty::Array`, which looks exactly like the discriminator and is
//!   not: the analyzer types a `:through` reader `Array[Room]` as well,
//!   because the type is its approximation of "a collection" and
//!   conflates precisely the two shapes this pass must separate.
//!   Gating on it rewrote a Relation's SELECT into a whole-row
//!   hydrate — the opposite of the fix, and a test caught it.
//!
//! So: rewrite when the reader's name is declared by a plain
//! `has_many`/`has_one` on EVERY model that declares one. A name that
//! is plain on one model and `:through` on another is left alone rather
//! than guessed at. A stated `Relation` or model `Class` on the
//! receiver short-circuits first, and a `Const` root stays a backstop.
//!
//! It leaves the cases where the receiver is a SCOPE on an association
//! (`room.users.without(x).pluck(:name)`) exactly as they are. Those
//! need to know what the scope answers, which is the association-proxy
//! question again.
//!
//! ONLY `pluck`. `ids` has the same shape and no failing call site;
//! adding it would be a second untested arm, and the pass that grows one
//! for a case nothing exercises is the pass that acquires its next bug.
