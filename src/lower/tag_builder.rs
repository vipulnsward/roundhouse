//! Rails' `tag.<name>(…)` TagBuilder → the HTML string it builds.
//!
//! `tag` is a proxy object whose `method_missing` turns any name into an
//! element (`tag.div`, `tag.details`, `tag.meta`). Nothing in an emitted
//! tree supplies it: a helper lowers to a module function with no view
//! context, so the call survives into the emit as a literal
//! `tag.details(…)` with `tag` unbound and takes the whole page down at
//! render. A runtime proxy is not the fix either — `method_missing` is
//! exactly what [[feedback_runtime_must_be_statically_resolvable]] rules
//! out, and a strict target cannot compile it at all.
//!
//! The element name is known at COMPILE time, though, which is what
//! makes this a lowering rather than a runtime concern. campfire writes
//! ~55 of these across 21 files, so it is the systematic surface
//! standing between the emit and any rendered page.
//!
//! ## What it produces
//!
//! Four shapes, by what the call carries:
//!
//! | source                              | result                                |
//! |-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
//! | `tag.meta name: "x"` (void element) | `"<meta name=\"x\">"`                 |
//! | `tag.div class: "x"`                | `"<div class=\"x\"></div>"`           |
//! | `tag.span "text", class: "x"`       | `"<span class=\"x\">text</span>"`     |
//! | `tag.div(class: "x") { … }`         | `"<div class=\"x\">" + capture { … } + "</div>"` |
//!
//! Attributes go through [`attr_parts::append_attr_parts`], the same
//! renderer the form builder uses — so `data:`/`aria:` hashes kebab-case
//! and flatten, boolean attributes render Rails' way (`required` when
//! truthy, ABSENT when falsy), and a nil value drops the attribute
//! instead of rendering `key=""`. Sharing that is the point: the rule is
//! Rails' and there should be one copy of it.
//!
//! The BLOCK form re-uses [`crate::lower::capture_inline`] rather than
//! reimplementing the buffer dance: campfire's blocks are written with
//! `concat`, which is precisely what `capture` models, so this pass
//! synthesizes the `capture { … }` that pass already knows how to
//! flatten into an accumulator. Hence the ordering constraint — this
//! runs BEFORE `capture_inline`, and before `html_safe`, which needs to
//! see the marker described next.
//!
//! ## Why the result is marked `.html_safe`
//!
//! Rails' tag builder returns a SafeBuffer, so `<%= tag.meta … %>` is
//! not escaped. Lowered to a bare string it would be — the view walker
//! escapes every interpolation it cannot prove safe, and `&lt;meta&gt;`
//! is not a meta tag. Wrapping the result in `.html_safe` says so in the
//! language the rest of the pipeline already speaks: the view walker's
//! `html_safe_value` unwraps it, and `html_safe` folds the marker away
//! AND registers the enclosing helper in `app.html_safe_methods`, so
//! callers of `translation_button` don't escape it either.
//!
//! ## Where it declines
//!
//! Attributes that are not a literal Hash — campfire's `tag.time
//! **attributes, datetime: …` desugars to a `merge` chain — cannot be
//! walked at compile time. Those fall back to the runtime
//! `ActionView::ViewHelpers.content_tag`, and are ledgered. The fallback
//! is what makes the pass TOTAL: every `tag.<name>` site becomes
//! something that runs, which is the whole point when the alternative is
//! an unbound `tag`.
//!
//! That example was aspirational until 2026-08-31: the fallback's guard
//! required `args.len() > 1`, and a call whose arguments are ENTIRELY
//! keywords has exactly one — so the lone merge chain was read as the
//! tag's CONTENT and stringified into its body. Every `<time>` campfire
//! rendered came out as `<time>{datetime: "…", data: {…}}</time>`. See
//! `is_kwsplat_merge_chain`.
//!
//! `content_tag` is not ruby-family only, despite what this note used to
//! claim: it and `render_attrs` are in the emitted spinel tree too
//! (`runtime/action_view/view_helpers.rb`, with `.rbs` signatures), which
//! is what makes the fallback a real answer on a strict target rather
//! than a deferred failure.
//!
//! ## Also here: `turbo_frame_tag`
//!
//! turbo-rails' frame helper is `tag.turbo_frame(…)` with its arguments
//! rearranged, and it reaches an emitted tree the same way — as an
//! unbound bare call in a helper body. It expands here for the same
//! reasons, through [`crate::lower::view_to_library::turbo_frames`],
//! which owns the rearranging and is shared with the view walker.
