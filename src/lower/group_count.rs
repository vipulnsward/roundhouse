//! Grouped-count grounding: `rel.group(:col).count` renames its
//! terminal to `group_count` — Rails' grouped count returns a Hash of
//! group-key => COUNT, a different type than the scalar `count`.
//! Splitting the name keeps both returns monomorphic (a count that
//! answers Integer-or-Hash is exactly the polymorphic-API shape the
//! runtime avoids); the runtime's `group_count` builds the
//! SELECT … GROUP BY and hydrates the Hash.
//!
//! Shape-directed: a zero-arg block-less `count` whose receiver is a
//! `group(...)` send (the corpus spelling — `group` directly before
//! the terminal). Runs on the post-analyze hook with its siblings so
//! every target consumes the grounded form.
