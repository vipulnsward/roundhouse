//! `record.errors.full_messages` → `record.errors`.
//!
//! The shared framework runtime's `errors` is already the array of
//! full-message strings — `validates` bakes humanized text at lower
//! time ("Short can't be blank") and hand-written `errors.add` calls
//! ground into the same shape (see [`super::errors_add`], which owns
//! that half and documents the accumulator invariant). Rails' extra
//! `.full_messages` hop is therefore an identity on our runtime, and
//! leaving it in place is not harmless: `Array[String]` has no
//! `full_messages`, so every strict target gets a hard unresolved-method
//! error at a site whose meaning we already know.
//!
//! Scope is `for_each_hook_body`, view bodies, and TEST bodies — the
//! construct has real presence in all three (lobsters reads it from
//! controllers, from models, and from an `application_helper`
//! error-list builder that views call). That matches
//! [`super::exclude_predicate`], the other total rewrite with a view
//! presence.
//!
//! Tests were the last to join, and asking for them by name is the
//! convention [`super::for_each_test_body`] documents. The site is
//! campfire's `assert_equal [ "Title can't be blank", … ],
//! opengraph.errors.full_messages` — an assertion reading the
//! accumulator directly, which is exactly the shape this pass folds
//! everywhere else. Left out, it read as a missing method on `Array`
//! and the identity we already knew went unapplied purely because of
//! which walk the pass had asked for.
//!
//! An equivalent rewrite already existed as `rewrite_errors_full_messages`
//! in the Roda ingest, applied to view bodies only. That copy is left in
//! place deliberately: it runs at INGEST, this runs post-analyze, and
//! the fold is idempotent (after either pass no `full_messages` send
//! survives for the other to match), so the lanes can overlap without
//! interfering. Retiring it is a separate cleanup with its own gate.
