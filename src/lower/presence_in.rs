//! ActiveSupport `Object#presence_in` grounding: `value.presence_in(list)`
//! → `ActiveSupport.presence_in(value, list)`.
//!
//! Rails defines it on Object as `in?(another) ? self : nil` — the
//! allow-list spelling for a value that came off the wire. campfire's
//! `Accounts::UsersController` writes the whole role check with it:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! { role: params.require(:user)[:role].presence_in(%w[ member administrator ]) || "member" }
//! ```
//!
//! Like `parameterize`, the original is a core_ext reopen only the
//! CRuby overlay could host, so every other target had an unresolved
//! call. `ActiveSupport` is the home its `presence` sibling already
//! uses, and one shared `runtime/ruby` body prices all thirteen targets.
//!
//! Receiver-shape only, no type gate: `presence_in` is declared on
//! Object, so there is no receiver type that would make the site mean
//! something else — unlike `parameterize`, which shares its name with
//! nothing but is still stamped `Str` to stay inside what the
//! `Inflector` body can answer.
