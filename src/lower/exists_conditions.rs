//! `Model.exists?(col: value)` → `Model.where(col: value).exists?`.
//!
//! Rails' `exists?` is three methods behind one name: no argument asks
//! whether the table has any row, an id asks for that row, and a
//! conditions hash is `where(conditions).exists?`. The runtime models
//! the id form only — `Base.exists?(id)` hands straight to
//! `_adapter_exists_by_id?` — so a conditions hash arrived at
//! `Db.escape_int` and died there (`undefined method 'to_i' for an
//! instance of Hash`).
//!
//! Splitting the name here rather than making the runtime method
//! polymorphic keeps the primitive monomorphic: an `is_a?(Hash)` branch
//! inside `exists?` would give it an untyped parameter, and every
//! strict target would then carry a runtime type test for a question
//! answered at compile time by the shape of the call.
//!
//! Runs before the arel rewrite, so the two possible outcomes are both
//! improvements on today:
//!
//!   * literal conditions — arel folds the whole `where(…).exists?`
//!     chain into one `SELECT 1 … LIMIT 1`, as it already does for a
//!     `Model.where(…)` written out longhand.
//!   * a runtime value (a method parameter, a call) — arel deliberately
//!     declines to inline those, since Rails decides per value whether
//!     it means `=`, `IN` or `IS NULL`, and the chain falls to the
//!     Relation. Which is exactly what the arel builder's own comment
//!     says should happen; it just had nowhere correct to land.
//!
//! The kwargs guard is what keeps the id form (and `File.exists?(path)`,
//! whose argument is positional) out of the rewrite.
