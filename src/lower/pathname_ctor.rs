//! `Pathname(path)` → `Pathname.new(path)`.
//!
//! Kernel's conversion FUNCTION, not a method on anything. CRuby mixes
//! it into Object when `pathname` is required, and it is defined as
//! exactly `Pathname.new(path)` — the only difference being that an
//! argument which is already a Pathname comes back identical rather
//! than as an equal copy, which no call site can tell apart (Pathname
//! is a string with methods; `==` and `hash` are the string's).
//!
//! Spinel's bundled `pathname` says so itself, in the package header:
//! the constructor "cannot be spelled in Spinel yet (a toplevel method
//! named after a class collides with the class's own symbol) -- use
//! Pathname.new". So this is not a workaround for a missing library —
//! the library is there, the CLASS-side spelling is the one it offers,
//! and it is the spelling every strict target can resolve without a
//! toplevel-function surface ([[feedback_runtime_must_be_statically_resolvable]]).
//!
//! campfire's `CableHelper.script_aware_action_cable_meta_tag` builds
//! the Action Cable URL with `Pathname(request.script_name) +
//! Pathname(mount_path)`, and the layout renders it into the `<head>`
//! of every page — so the bare call stopped the spinel build on a line
//! that runs on every request.
//!
//! Only the one-argument form is rewritten, which is the only form
//! Kernel defines.
