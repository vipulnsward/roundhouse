//! ActiveSupport's `Object#in?` → `<arg>.include?(<recv>)`.
//!
//! The mirror of `exclude_predicate` beside this file, and it reaches
//! the same wall for the same reason: `in?` is a core_ext reopen on
//! Object whose whole body is `collection.include?(self)`, and no
//! transpiled runtime can reopen the builtin. The analyzer has typed
//! the call `Ty::Bool` since before anything implemented it
//! (`analyze::body::send`), which is the shape that hides this kind of
//! gap — the type table answers, so nothing looks missing until a body
//! runs. campfire's `Opengraph::Metadata::Fetching` writes three of
//! them, and all ten tests in `opengraph_metadata_test` died on the
//! first.
//!
//! Unlike `exclude?` this rewrite SWAPS receiver and argument, so it
//! also swaps their evaluation ORDER: `f().in?(g())` evaluates `f`
//! first, `g().include?(f())` evaluates `g` first. Every site in the
//! corpus has a pure receiver and a constant collection
//! (`content_type.in?(ALLOWED_IMAGE_CONTENT_TYPES)`), and a rewrite
//! that preserved order would have to bind a temporary — a statement
//! where this pass only has an expression. Named here rather than
//! silently accepted; a site with two effectful sides is the one to
//! come back for.
//!
//! Same wholesale opt-out as `exclude?`: an app defining its own `in?`
//! means something else by the name, and per-class checking is no help
//! when the receiver is the value rather than the definer.
