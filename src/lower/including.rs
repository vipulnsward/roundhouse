//! ActiveSupport's `Enumerable#including` → `<recv>.to_a + [args]`.
//!
//! `including(*elements)` is a core_ext one-liner (`dup.concat(elements)`
//! on Array, `to_a + elements` on Enumerable) and hits the same wall as
//! `exclude?` next door: no transpiled runtime can reopen the builtin,
//! so the call has to become the expression it stands for.
//!
//! `.to_a` on the receiver rather than a bare `+`, because the name is
//! Enumerable's and reaches BOTH shapes campfire writes it on — a plain
//! Array (`params.fetch(:user_ids, []).including(Current.user.id)`) and
//! a relation-rooted chain. `to_a` is identity on the first and
//! materializes the second, which is exactly what Rails' Enumerable
//! definition does; rewriting to a bare `+` would be right for the Array
//! and a missing-method for the relation.
//!
//! Args become one Array literal, so the multi-element form
//! (`xs.including(a, b)`) is the same rewrite as the single. Rails
//! flattens one level for the splat form; nothing in the corpus passes
//! a splat, and flattening a genuine Array ELEMENT would be wrong, so
//! the args ride as written.
//!
//! Stands down wholesale if any app class defines its own `including`,
//! for the reason `exclude_predicate` gives: `including` sites are on
//! collections, so a receiver type rarely names the defining class, and
//! a global opt-out is the honest reading of "this app means something
//! else by that name".
