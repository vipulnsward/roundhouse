//! Target-neutral route flattening.
//!
//! A `RouteTable` stores routes in their source shape —
//! `resources :articles do ... end` blocks, `root "home#index"`
//! shorthand, and explicit `get "/path", to: "c#a"` entries.
//! Every pass-2 emitter needs the expanded, concrete form: one
//! entry per (method, path, controller, action) with a helper
//! name derived from `as:` or the action, plus the list of
//! path-param names.
//!
//! Lifted from six near-identical per-target walkers
//! (`flatten_<lang>_routes` / `collect_flat_<lang>_routes` /
//! `nest_<lang>_path` / `extract_<lang>_path_params` /
//! `<lang>_resource_as_name`). The IR walk is target-independent
//! — only the downstream rendering differs (Go: `ArticlesPath`,
//! Python: `articles_path`, Rust: `articles_path(i64)`, etc.).
