//! `recv.try(:m)` guards DEFINEDNESS, not nilness.
//!
//! ActiveSupport:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! def try(method_name = nil, *args, &b)
//!   if method_name.nil? ... elsif respond_to?(method_name)
//!     public_send(method_name, *args, &b)
//!   end
//! end
//! ```
//!
//! (plus `NilClass#try`, which answers nil for everything). Ingest used
//! to ground it to `recv && recv.m` — the `&.` desugar. The two agree
//! exactly when the receiver either is nil or DOES define the method,
//! which is most sites and not all:
//!
//! ```ruby
//! # campfire's own turbo_test_helper, over [room, :messages]
//! streambles.collect { |s| s.try(:to_gid_param) || s }.join(":")
//! ```
//!
//! `:messages` is not nil and answers no `to_gid_param`, so Rails
//! returns nil and takes the `|| s` arm. The nil guard called it and
//! raised — `undefined method 'to_gid_param' for an instance of Symbol`
//! — which is campfire's `test_creating_a_message_broadcasts_the_
//! message_to_the_room`, the app's own assertion of the behaviour
//! `scripts/campfire-cable-walk` demonstrates.
//!
//! `respond_to?` IS THE ONE ANSWER THIS PIPELINE CANNOT EMIT — a
//! runtime dispatch question, and the strict targets compile the test
//! tree too. What it CAN do is ask the tree which classes define the
//! name, because that set is closed:
//!
//! * every class descending from a common ancestor `B` defines it, and
//!   nothing outside does -> `recv.is_a?(B) ? recv.m : nil`
//! * a handful of unrelated classes define it -> the same, over a
//!   disjunction
//! * nothing in the tree defines it -> the call can only ever answer
//!   nil, so fold to `nil`
//! * too many unrelated definers to name -> keep the nil guard, and say
//!   so in the ledger rather than emit a twenty-arm `is_a?` chain
//!
//! WHY THE NARROWING IS SAFE WHERE THE NIL GUARD WAS NOT: `nil.is_a?(B)`
//! is false, so a nil receiver still answers nil — the narrowing does
//! everything the nil guard did, and answers nil for the non-nil
//! receiver that does not define the method instead of raising on it.
//!
//! The bound that keeps this honest is that `m` is a LITERAL at every
//! corpus site (`:username`, `"is_moderator"`). A computed method name
//! is left as a plain `try` send for the analyzer to report.
