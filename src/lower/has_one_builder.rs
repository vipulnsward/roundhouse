//! `owner.create_<assoc>!(k: v)` → `Target.create!(fk: owner.id, k: v)`,
//! for a `has_one :assoc`, and the `create_`/`build_` forms beside it.
//!
//! Rails generates four methods per `has_one` — `build_x`, `create_x`,
//! `create_x!`, `reload_x` — on top of the reader and writer that
//! `model_to_library::associations` already synthesizes. campfire calls
//! exactly one of them, `user.create_webhook!(url: …)` in
//! `User::Bot.create_bot!`, and it was one of the ten strict-emit
//! errors: the emitted tree CALLED it and nothing defined it, so typing
//! it without lowering it would have been a method that types and then
//! raises.
//!
//! A CALL-SITE REWRITE, not a synthesized method, for the reason
//! `destroy_by` states next door: a method defined on `Base` is a method
//! on every model in every target, and the attributes hash is a
//! different shape at every call site, so each strict target would have
//! to give that parameter a type. The kwargs stay at the call site,
//! where they are literal, and become `create!`'s own hash — which is
//! exactly the shape the AR catalog already types. It also sidesteps
//! kwarg FORWARDING, which the strict targets do not support: nothing is
//! forwarded, the arguments are inlined into the constructor call.
//!
//! BOTH RECEIVER FORMS. campfire writes each once:
//! `user.create_webhook!(url: …)` in `User::Bot.create_bot!`, and a bare
//! `create_webhook!(url: url)` in `User::Bot#update_webhook_url!`. The
//! explicit form resolves its owner from the receiver's stamped type;
//! the implicit one cannot, so it is resolved structurally — a model's
//! own body owns itself, and a CONCERN's body is owned by the model that
//! includes it, but only when exactly one model does. With two includers
//! the same bare name could mean two different targets, and guessing
//! would emit a row against the wrong table; that stays a gap.
//!
//! Scope is `has_one` only. `belongs_to`'s builders write the foreign key
//! back onto the RECEIVER (`user.create_account!` sets `user.account_id`)
//! rather than onto the new record, which is a different rewrite with an
//! assignment in it; it lands when a fixture demands it, the way HABTM
//! does in `associations`. `reload_<assoc>` is likewise absent — the
//! reader re-queries on every call here, so a reload has nothing to
//! invalidate, and inventing it would imply a cache that does not exist.
