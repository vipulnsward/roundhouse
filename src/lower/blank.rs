//! ActiveSupport blank-predicate lowering: ground `blank?` /
//! `present?` / `presence` by the receiver's *static* type so every
//! target compiles the site without an `Object` monkey-patch.
//!
//! ActiveSupport ships these as core_ext reopens of `Object`/`String`
//! (`respond_to?(:empty?) ? !!empty? : !self`) — a shape only the
//! CRuby overlay can host. Every other target either can't reopen
//! builtins (transpiled runtimes) or can't dispatch a user-defined
//! method on an untyped value at all (spinel AOT). The types the
//! analyzer already stamped make the dynamic dispatch unnecessary at
//! almost every site, so this pass rewrites, per receiver type:
//!
//!   String        blank? → `r.strip.empty?` (see below)
//!   Array/Hash    blank? → `r.empty?`
//!   Class w/ own  left as-is when the app class defines the
//!   definition    predicate itself; grounded via `empty?` when it
//!                 defines that (`ActiveRecord::Relation` included)
//!   other Class / blank? → `false` (a non-nil value with no `empty?`
//!   Int/Float/    is never blank — matches AS, where `0` and
//!   Sym/Time      `Time.now` are present)
//!   Bool          blank? → `!r` (`false` is blank)
//!   T | Nil       nil-check composed with the T grounding
//!
//! `present?` is the negation; `presence` is `blank? ? nil : r`
//! (an `If` node), or just `r` where T is never blank.
//!
//! ## Why the String case strips first
//!
//! ActiveSupport's `String#blank?` is a whitespace match — the regex is
//! `\A[[:space:]]*\z` — and not `empty?`, so `" ".blank?` is TRUE in
//! Rails where a bare `empty?` answers false. campfire's bot API is the
//! site that priced it: a boost posted with a body of three spaces was
//! accepted and stored where Rails answers 422.
//!
//! `strip` rather than the regex because every target emitter carries
//! it and a POSIX character class is not a shape every regex backend
//! shares. The divergence that leaves is NON-ASCII whitespace: Ruby's
//! `String#strip` takes ASCII space plus NUL, where `[[:space:]]` also
//! takes U+00A0 and friends. No corpus app has one, and the targets
//! disagree there among themselves anyway — Python's `.strip()` and
//! JavaScript's `.trim()` do take them.
//!
//! The nil-safety patch this used to be deferred behind
//! (`emit::ruby::library::rewrite_empty_nilsafe`, which wraps the
//! receiver of `empty?` as `(r || "")`) now looks THROUGH the `.strip`,
//! so a nullable column still reads `(r || "").strip.empty?` and not
//! `(r.strip || "").empty?`, which would have raised on nil before the
//! guard could answer.
//!
//! NOT the same question as the view-cond predicate rewrite
//! (`view_to_library::predicates`), which still emits a plain `empty?`.
//! That pass runs with NO receiver type and folds `blank?`, `empty?`
//! and `none?` onto one form, so a `.strip` there would land on
//! collections too.
//!
//! Residue policy: a receiver the pass can't ground — `untyped`, an
//! open inference var, a multi-variant union — keeps its dynamic call
//! and gets a `blank_unlowered` warning naming the site. That list is
//! the ledger: on CRuby the overlay still serves the call at runtime;
//! on AOT/strict targets each entry is a named per-target gap instead
//! of a silent compile error. Same policy when a form that must
//! re-evaluate (or drop) the receiver meets a receiver with effects:
//! skip and report rather than change evaluation order.
//!
//! Test-module and fixture bodies are not walked (they run on CRuby
//! where the overlay serves the dynamic call); extendable when a
//! strict-target test lane needs it. View bodies are not walked
//! either — see the note in [`apply_blank_lowering`].

/// **A schema type describes the COLUMN, not what the attribute holds

/// resolve, and it carries the identical whitespace rule (`" "` is
