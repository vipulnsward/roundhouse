///
/// Two edits per non-polymorphic belongs_to:
///
///   1. the writer stashes an UNSAVED value in the reader's cache —
///      a record with no id yet cannot be found again from the foreign
///      key, so something has to hold it until the save;
///   2. `_autosave_<name>` saves it and takes the id, folded into
///      `before_validation`.
///
/// ```ruby
/// def creator=(value)
///   if value.nil?
///     @creator_id = 0
///   else
///     @creator_id = value.id
///     if value.id == 0

/// ```
///
/// A SAVED value deliberately does not populate the cache, so the
/// reader keeps re-querying by foreign key for those and a later direct
/// write to the key cannot be answered from a stale object.
///
/// WHY RUBY-FAMILY AND NOT THE SHARED LOWERING. This started shared and
/// the strict targets refused it, each in its own way — the two of them
/// do not even agree on the shape of the slot being read:
///
///   * Rust emits the cache field as a plain `Article`, so `.nil?`
///     became `is_null()` on a struct that has no such method;
///   * Crystal emits it as `Article?`, so dropping the nil test to
///     satisfy Rust gave `undefined method 'save' for Nil`;
///   * `new_record?` lives on the runtime `Base`, which a strict
///     target's model — a plain struct — never inherits;
///   * and an unstamped `@fk = <cache>.id` typed the foreign-key column
///     `Ty::Var`, which Rust reads as "already a Value": `article_id`
///     flipped from `i64` to `serde_json::Value` and took eleven E0308s
///     with it.
///
/// There is no single spelling that satisfies both, so this joins
/// `apply_through_assoc_lowering` as a Ruby-family capability and the
/// strict targets keep the gap they already had, ledgered in
/// docs/pipeline/runtime.md.
///
/// Ordering inside `before_validation` is load-bearing: the autosave
/// call is pushed BEFORE the belongs_to `default:` statement, which is
/// guarded on `@creator_id == 0`. Fill the key first or an explicitly

/// Hoisting rather than constant-FOLDING is deliberate: computing the

/// dispatches to the model's override. Our helpers declare their
/// segments `String` (`routes_to_library::param_ty` — a slug segment
/// typed Int made every strict-target call site passing `short_id` a C
/// type error), and a declared type is a promise the caller has to

/// — `tag_path(tag)` rendered `/t/` with an EMPTY segment long before
/// `String#to_param` raised on it. The raise was the visible half of a

///      the `reference_targets` relation, rebuilt from `app.models`
///      because view bodies reach emit with `Ty::Var` args;
///   3. the arg is a bare name that IS a model name (`tag`, `@user`) —
///      the same convention the view lowerer's `ivar_ty` commits to.
///
/// Everything else is left alone, which is the whole reason the rule is
/// positive-signal-only: `tag.id`, `story.short_id`, `user.username`,

// ─── Runtime-Relation eager loading (issue #27 follow-up) ──────────────
//
// The static arel path already lowers `includes(:assoc)` into inline
// preload statements, but chains that reach the runtime
// `ActiveRecord::Relation` (scope chains, association relations) only
// RECORDED their `includes(...)` specs — `to_a` never executed them, so
// every association read was a lazy per-row query (the lobsters 2x
// query-count gap vs Rails, ~985 excess queries per benchmark pass:
// belongs_to singles ~870, has_many/through ~295).
//
// This pass synthesizes, per model, the statically-dispatched preload
// machinery `Relation#to_a` calls (`@model.preload_associations(records,
// @includes)` — Base supplies a no-op default):
//
//   def self.preload_associations(records, specs)   # spec walker
//   def self._preload_dispatch(records, name, nested)  # case-dispatch
//   def self._preload_batch_<assoc>(records)        # one batched IN load
//   def _preload_<belongs_to>(rec)                  # cache setter
//
// plus a cache guard prepended to each belongs_to reader (mirroring the
// has_many readers' `return @x_cache if @x_loaded` shape; the has_many
// setters/caches already exist from the static-path work).
//
// No method_missing, no send: nested specs (`story: :user`) recurse
// through the case arm's statically-named target class — the same
// case-dispatch shape as dynamic-partial rendering. Bodies are generated
// as Ruby source and parsed back through `runtime_src::parse_methods`
// (templates are fixed; identifiers come from assoc/table names).
//
// Two framework-owned associations batch the same way, under Rails'
// own names: `has_one_attached :<attr>` as `<attr>_attachment` (one
// join over the attachment and blob tables, installing a row-bearing
// `ActiveStorage::Attached` on each record) and `has_rich_text :<attr>`
// as `rich_text_<attr>` (one `IN` over `action_text_rich_texts`,
// installing the record through the owner's load-once setter). The
// `with_attached_*` / `with_rich_text_*` scopes preload these names, so
// campfire's `Message.with_attachment_details` costs the room page two
// queries where it cost eighty.
//
// Known gaps, deliberate: has_one, direct has_many with a scope or
// polymorphic owner, and scope-carrying through-assocs (other than a
// plain `order("...")`) get no batch arm — the dispatch
// falls through and the lazy reader stays correct (just N+1, matching
// Rails, which also lazy-loads what `includes` doesn't name). Assigning
// a belongs_to (`c.story = s`) on a PRELOADED record does not refresh
// the cache (fresh records never have the loaded flag set, so the
// benchmark's build-then-render flows are unaffected).

/// at. Widening this is a typed-safe-string project, not a bigger match
