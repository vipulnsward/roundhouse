//! Structured diagnostics carried with the IR.
//!
//! A [`DiagnosticKind`] is an annotation set on an [`crate::expr::Expr`]
//! (via its `diagnostic` field) or produced by a post-analyze walker
//! (via [`crate::analyze::diagnose`]). Both paths funnel into the same
//! [`Diagnostic`] shape so a future renderer (likely miette) has one
//! type to format.
//!
//! The split between "annotation on Expr" and "walker-produced" is
//! historical: older kinds (`IvarUnresolved`, `SendDispatchFailed`)
//! are produced by traversing the analyzed tree and inferring from
//! context. Newer kinds (`IncompatibleBinop`) are set directly by the
//! body-typer at the point of detection. Over time the walker-based
//! ones can migrate to annotations too; the visible output is the
//! same either way.
