//! The inference type lattice `Ty` that analyze stamps onto every
//! expression and emitters translate into each target's type system.
//! Rails-specific shapes are first-class variants — `Relation` so
//! query chains can be reasoned about across method boundaries (and
//! folded to SQL) instead of degrading to arrays, `Time` so each
//! target maps its native datetime — because adding a variant forces
//! every exhaustive match to handle it explicitly. Three "no type"
//! variants mean different things: `Var` is an unsolved inference
//! variable (a residual one surfaces as an `UnresolvedType` warning),
//! `Untyped` is RBS `untyped` — a deliberate gradual opt-out that
//! strict targets reject at emit — and `Bottom` is raise/never,
//! absorbed by unions so a raising branch doesn't widen the type.
