//! Vendored-extras façades — the table, shared by ingest and emit.
//!
//! This lives outside `emit/` because the façade is not only an emit-time
//! substitution: its hand-written `.rbs` is the typing contract ANALYSIS
//! must see. Leaving the table in the emitter meant the contract could
//! only ever be applied after inference had already run, which is how
//! `OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes` stayed untyped and cost lobsters two C
//! errors ten inference links downstream.

/// App-defined classes whose bodies drive un-modeled native/stdlib
/// surface or a spinel-refused control-flow shape. Spinel AOT prices
/// every method body in the reachable require graph, and these bodies
/// cannot compile — so the scaffold base swaps their emitted files for
/// hand-written raising façades at the SAME emit path, leaving the
/// require graph untouched. The CRuby tree, where the real gems/stdlib
/// exist and the source runs as written, restores the verbatim emit via
/// `restore_extras_facades`. Same raise-loudly contract as
/// runtime/ruby/gem_facades.rb.
///
/// - Sponge = Net::HTTP + Resolv + IPAddr + OpenSSL (pending the stdlib
///   spin packages).
/// - Markdowner walks a Markly DOM with a recursive block-driving helper
///   (`walk_text_nodes` forwards `&block` through `Markly::Node#each`);
///   that identity-forwarding block-through-a-yielding-method recursion
///   is a deliberate spinel always-inline boundary (matz/spinel#2948).
///   All consumers are write-path (`markeddown_*` precomputed on save),
///   so the read benchmark never renders markdown. Real fix = a
///   Commonmarker façade over the gem's iterative `Node#walk`.
/// - CachePageJob warms the page cache through an
///   `ActionDispatch::Integration::Session`; `caches_page` itself is
///   dropped, and no AOT runtime carries an integration session.
/// - StoryImage composites a logo with vips operations (`flatten`,
///   `resize`, `insert`) spinel-ruby-vips does not carry yet.
/// - FlaggedCommenters computes flag statistics with MySQL-only SQL
///   (stddev(), if()) under `Rails.cache.fetch` blocks whose bodies
///   also carry un-modeled calls (`exec_query().first.symbolize_keys!`,
///   select-alias readers); the lobsters-bench capture disables the
///   feature rather than port that SQL to SQLite. Constructor and
///   readers stay real; the statistics methods raise. Current lobsters
///   registers both functions for SQLite, and then the real class
///   serves (`lifted_by_sql_functions`).
