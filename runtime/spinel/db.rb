# Primitive Db surface — the layer that per-model adapter code sits on
# top of. The contract is database-agnostic; this file is the
# SQLite-via-libsqlite3-FFI implementation, the runtime spinel-compiled
# binaries use. The sqlite3-gem-backed sibling (`db_cruby.rb`) is the
# stock-CRuby implementation; both define `module Db` with the same
# external API. main.rb requires this file (the FFI variant);
# test_helper.rb requires `db_cruby` (the gem variant) so the existing
# `ruby -Itest test/...` developer loop keeps working under stock CRuby.
#
# API (the contract every Db shim must satisfy — must match db_cruby.rb):
#
#   Db.configure(path)         — open a database (":memory:" for tests)
#   Db.close                   — close the database
#   Db.exec(sql)               — run DDL / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
#   Db.prepare(sql)            — prepare a SELECT, returns stmt handle
#   Db.step?(stmt)             — advance, returns true if a row arrived
#   Db.column_int(stmt, i)     — read int column at zero-based index
#   Db.column_float(stmt, i)   — read float (REAL) column at zero-based index
#   Db.column_text(stmt, i)    — read text column at zero-based index
#   Db.column_count(stmt)      — number of columns in the prepared row
#   Db.column_name(stmt, i)    — name of column at zero-based index
#   Db.finalize(stmt)          — release the prepared stmt
#   Db.bind_int(stmt, i, v)    — bind int to `?` param i (1-based)
#   Db.bind_text(stmt, i, v)   — bind string to `?` param i (1-based)
#   Db.bind_bool(stmt, i, v)   — bind 0/1 to `?` param i (1-based)
#   Db.last_insert_rowid       — id of the last INSERTed row
#   Db.changes                 — affected-row count of the last statement
#   Db.escape_string(s)        — SQL-quote a string value
#   Db.escape_int(n)           — render an integer for SQL inlining
#
# Stmt handles are opaque pointers (`:ptr`) returned by sqlite3_prepare_v2
# via the SQL.stmt_out out-buffer. Two value paths coexist: the lowerer
# INLINES literals (`escape_string`/`escape_int`, both shimmed below) and
# BINDS runtime values (`bind_*`) when the placeholder-bind gate is on
# (roundhouse#12, ROUNDHOUSE_PARAM_BINDS). Binding keys the
# prepared-statement cache by static shape (`WHERE id = ?`) instead of
# per-value, so a query hammered with varying ids reuses one cached stmt.
# `bind_text` is unblocked at the FFI layer (spinel #576 +
# matz/spinel#686 doc fix).
#
# Module-level state is `@pools`, N independent DbPool shards of M opaque
# dbh ptrs each (see `configure` for why it is sharded rather than one
# opaque dbh ptrs). `Db.current_conn` reads Thread.current[:db_conn] when
# set (request-scoped checkout) and falls back to the pool's first free
# handle otherwise (single-fiber test/dev mode). Existing call sites don't
# care which path they're on; they just call Db.X.
#
# Pattern mirrors `examples/ffi/sqlite/blog.rb` in the spinel repo —
# the same `ffi_func` declarations, the same out-buffer plumbing.

# Bare-metal SQLite3 FFI bindings. Only the surface area Roundhouse's
# lowerer-emitted `_adapter_*` methods need.

# One pooled SQLite connection plus its prepared-statement cache
# (roundhouse#12). Prepared stmts are bound to the connection they were
# prepared on and carry their own cursor, so the cache MUST be
# per-connection: a global SQL->stmt map would let two cooperative fibers
# (each leasing a different pool handle) hand back the same stmt and
# corrupt each other's cursor mid-iteration. Because the pool leases a
# DbConn to exactly one fiber at a time, the per-connection cache is also
# concurrency-safe without a mutex.
#
# Cache key is the fully-composed SQL string. With the placeholder-bind
# gate on (roundhouse#12), runtime values emit as `?` and the key is the
# static query shape (`WHERE id = ?`), so a query hammered with varying
# ids reuses one entry. With the gate off the lowerer inlines literals
# (`WHERE id = 1`) and id-bearing queries key per-id; the CAP below
# bounds growth in that mode.
#
# CAP bounds the CACHE. Until 2026-07-29 it did NOT bound the prepared
# STATEMENTS, and the difference was the AOT lane's whole memory story.
# Past the cap `prepare_cached` still prepared a stmt and returned it
# UNCACHED, and `Db.finalize` — which resets rather than closes, correct
# for a cached stmt that must survive for its next use — never finalized
# it. Nothing held a reference, so every query past the cap leaked one
# sqlite3 stmt and its compiled program. With the bind gate OFF (the
# default) keys are per-VALUE, so the cap is reached almost immediately
# and effectively every query leaked: measured at ~8 MB per 114-visit
# benchmark iteration, growing linearly to the 535 MB peak the published
# page reports — the worst cell on it, and above Rails.
#
# What made that hard to see from outside: it is invisible to the obvious
# probes. Replaying ONE route is flat however many times (its few shapes
# fit under the cap), and it is indifferent to page size — 4560 renders of
# the 292 KB /u tree retain the same ~27 MB as 4560 renders of the 2 KB
# /about. Only a MIX of routes overflows the cap, so the growth looked
# like it tracked route variety rather than the cap it actually tracked.
#
# The fix is the CRuby shim's (db_cruby.rb): never hand back an uncached
# stmt — bound the cache by EVICTING, and finalize what's evicted. The
# one hazard is closing a stmt some open cursor still holds; lobsters'
# comment tree nests cursors, and an outer one can stay open across many
# inner queries. CRuby can check directly (it hands out an index into a
# @rows table and can ask whether an entry still holds a stmt); this shim
# hands back the raw ptr, so it has no such table to consult.
#
# So eviction runs at the REQUEST BOUNDARY instead, where no cursor is
# open by construction — `with_connection` returns only after the whole
# request body has run. Within a request the cache is a soft bound; at
# every boundary it comes back down to CAP and the excess is finalized.
# Bounded, and it can never close a live stmt.
# One cache entry: the composed SQL and its prepared stmt ptr. A concrete
# user class (not a raw ptr) so an Array of these types concretely the way
# ConnectionPool's @free does — spinel infers the element type from the
# first `push`, which lets `length`/`[]` resolve (a poly_array of bare ptrs

  # ── the per-request query cache ─────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # Rails wraps every request in the Active Record query cache: an
  # identical SELECT within one request replays the first result, and
  # any write empties the cache. The CRuby shim (db_cruby.rb) has had
  # the same discipline since issue #12; this lane had only the
  # prepared-statement cache above, so every repeat was a round trip —
  # campfire's `Current.account` is `Account.first`, asked 23 times per
  # page, and a message's `room` 40 times on a room page. Rails answers
  # those from this cache, which is why its count is what it is.
  #
  # The cache lives on the CONNECTION, which `Db.with_connection` leases
  # to exactly one request at a time — so it needs no fiber-local, and
  # a thread-per-connection server leases the same way.
  #
  # Handles: a replay is an INTEGER, the 1-based index of its cursor in
  # `@qc_cursors`; a real stmt is its FFI POINTER, as before. The two are
  # different kinds of value, and the `Db.step?` / `Db.column_*` /
  # `Db.finalize` funnel asks `is_a?(Integer)` to tell them apart, so the
  # emitted readers are unchanged. (Not a sign bit: a pointer cannot be

# Dedicated SQLite connection pool (roundhouse#12). A single-use object so
# its instance ivars type concretely: @conns is a DbConn PtrArray (objects
# keep their tag, unlike the generic ConnectionPool's int slot), @free is
# an IntArray stack of available indices into @conns.
class DbPool
  # PRAGMAs ARE PER-CONNECTION, so they run on every handle the pool opens,
  # not once on the first. (The same reason runtime/go/v2/db.go sets them in
  # the DSN rather than with a one-shot Exec.)
  #
  # WHY THESE, MEASURED. This runtime was the only one setting no pragmas at
  # all — kotlin, csharp, go and typescript each set theirs — and a file-backed
  # server pays for that on every request. SQLite's default page cache is 2 MB;
  # the lobsters fixture is 42 MB, so a long-lived process re-reads the same
  # pages from the OS on every visit instead of keeping the working set. On the
  # bench that showed up as ~400 `pread64` syscalls per /top visit, with 75% of
  # the profile inside libsqlite3 and under 6% in compiled code. One query
  # repeated six times on one connection against that fixture: 1,762 preads at
  # the default, 516 with a large cache — the rest was re-reading what it had
  # already read.
  #
  # cache_size is NEGATIVE on purpose: sqlite reads a positive value as a page
  # COUNT and a negative one as a KiB budget, so -65536 is 64 MiB regardless of
  # page_size, while 65536 would be 64k PAGES — 256 MiB at the 4 KiB default,
  # and silently different again on a fixture built with another page size.
  #
  # An in-memory database ignores all three (its pages are already the heap),
  # which is harmless: this is a fixed cost at boot on a path that then does
  # nothing.
  PRAGMAS = [
    "PRAGMA cache_size=-65536",
    # Read pages straight out of the page cache by mapping the file, which
    # drops the read() syscall and its copy for everything that fits.
    "PRAGMA mmap_size=268435456",
    # WAL for readers-alongside-writer, and a bounded wait rather than an
    # immediate SQLITE_BUSY when a write does overlap — what the sibling
    # runtimes set, and what a pool of connections on one file needs.
    "PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL",
    "PRAGMA busy_timeout=5000",
    # NORMAL, because FULL fsyncs the WAL on EVERY COMMIT and Rails does
    # not. Measured on the bench box: 1000 commits cost 5.573s at FULL
    # and 0.046s at NORMAL — 5.57ms against 0.05ms, a factor of 100.
    #
    # It was costing us a published number. campfire writes a presence
    # row per cable connection, so the 1,000-socket connect storm read
    # 5.87s with presence on and 0.32s with it off; the 5.55s difference
    # is 1000 fsyncs almost exactly. Nothing about the accept path was
    # slow — it does ~10,000 accepts/s, and draining the backlog is no
    # faster than one accept per wake.
    #
    # AND IT WAS NOT A LIKE-FOR-LIKE COMPARISON — for a reason that is
    # not in anyone's code. Asked directly, the Rails oracle's live
    # connection answers `synchronous = 1`, and so does the CRuby emit's,
    # which sets NO pragmas at all: both link the sqlite3 gem's bundled
    # SQLite, whose WAL default is NORMAL. The binary links its own, and
    # that one defaults to FULL. So three lanes on one benchmark were
    # running two different durability settings, decided by a
    # compile-time default nobody had written down.
    #
    # Which is why this is SET rather than left to agree by accident.
    # The sibling shims (db_cruby.rb, db_jruby.rb) still set nothing and
    # happen to read NORMAL today; a gem rebuilt with a different
    # default would move them silently, and that is the shape of bug
    # this line exists to remove.
    #
    # The trade is the standard WAL one and worth stating: NORMAL is
    # safe across a process crash and risks only the most recent commits
    # on OS or power failure. That is the guarantee campfire ships with,
    # so it is the one to match.
