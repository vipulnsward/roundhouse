# Spinel-subset temporal intrinsics: ActiveSupport.parse_db_time /
# db_now. Sibling of the CRuby/JRuby overlay's
# ruby_overlay/runtime/active_support_time_parsing.rb, which shadows
# this file on those trees (dedupe last-wins) with the stdlib-backed
# implementation. This one avoids everything spinel's Time lacks —
# no `require "time"`, no `Time.parse`, no `usec` reader.
#
# The synthesized temporal-column readers call `parse_db_time`
# (apply_datetime_lowering runs on the spinel-shape emit too) and
# `Base#save`'s fill_timestamps calls `db_now`. Until spinel's
# unresolved-call gate turned strict (spinel 1356cb14), both calls
# silently no-op'd here — readers returned nil, stamps were skipped —
# because the spinel tree simply lacked the module (spinel#1661).
#
# Storage form is Rails' fixed-width "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.ffffff]"
# TEXT (implicitly UTC, `T` tolerated as the separator), so a
# positional parse is exact. Sub-second storage survives writes
# (db_now stamps it via Time#to_f) but truncates on read —
# `Time.utc` takes whole seconds; comparisons and strftime in the
# corpus are second-granularity, and JSON serializes from the raw
# string (`<col>_raw`), not the parsed Time.

  # ---- THE TEST CLOCK ------------------------------------------------
  #
  # `ActiveSupport.now` is the ONE time read in this runtime. Every
  # other one calls it — `db_now` below, `Duration#ago`/`#from_now`
  # beside it — so `travel_to` in the test harness can move the clock
  # for the whole app with a single write, and a model does not have to
  # know it is under test.
  #
  # ActiveSupport's own `TimeHelpers` do this by stubbing `Time.now`,
  # which needs a reopened built-in; the shared runtime cannot reopen
  # one, and spinel AOT cannot stub at all. A module function every
  # caller already routes through is the same seam without either.
  #
  # An ARRAY, not a module ivar: `TRANSPORTS` in broadcasts.rb holds
  # mutable module state the same way, and the literal `[0]` is what
  # pins the element type for spinel.
  #
  # PRODUCTION IS ZERO. Nothing outside the harness ever calls
  # `travel`, so `now` is `Time.now` plus a constant-folded 0.
  TRAVEL_OFFSET = [0]

  # that zone before any render, so `getlocal` resolves against it.
  # Doing the shift HERE rather than at each render site is what makes
  # strftime, iso8601 and pubDate agree without every call site knowing
  # about zones — the same seam the CRuby overlay's twin uses.
  #
  # The offset is DST-correct because libc resolves the instant against
  # the host's tzdata: America/Chicago is -0500 in July and -0600 in
  # January. Nothing is baked at compile time except the zone NAME.

  # RFC 2822 date, the shape stdlib `time` gives `Time#rfc2822` — which

  # reopening `Time` (a reopened built-in loses its own method table for
  # self-calls). Composed from strftime instead, whose `%a`/`%b` are the
  # English abbreviations RFC 2822 requires on every locale.
  #
  # The zone tail is the receiver's own offset, via `%z`.
  #
  # NOT stdlib's `utc? ? "-0000" : <offset>` conditional, for two
  # reasons. Reachability: every value that gets here came from
  # `parse_db_time`, which ends in `.getlocal`, so the receiver is always
  # the host-local kind and `utc?` is always false — including when the
  # app declares no `config.time_zone` and the pin lands on "UTC", where
  # a local-kind Time at offset 0 renders "+0000" and stdlib agrees.
  # Typing: `utc?` is not reachable on this receiver anyway — the RBS
  # types the parameter `Time?`, and calling it raises NoMethodError at
  # runtime on the boxed value (measured: /rss 500s).
  #
  # The divergence this leaves is a caller handing us a true `Time.utc`,
  # which would render "+0000" where stdlib renders "-0000". No such
  # caller exists; the RSS feed reads `story.created_at`.
  #
  # This used to be a hardcoded "-0000" on the belief that spinel's Time
  # had no zone model to branch on. It does — `utc?`, `zone`,
  # `utc_offset` and `getlocal` all exist, and sp_Time carries a 3-state
  # zone kind, added 2026-07 in matz/spinel 1a7c3597 + fb6e6685. The last
  # real blocker was that strftime and iso8601 rendered UTC clock fields
  # for a fixed-offset Time, so `getlocal` output could not be trusted;
