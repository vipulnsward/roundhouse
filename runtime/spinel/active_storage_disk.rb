# Active Storage's BYTES half, for the ruby family: the disk service,
# the attachable coercion, the image analyzer, and the three engine
# routes that serve a blob back. Reopens the shared
# `runtime/ruby/active_storage.rb`, whose own header says why each of
# these is a per-target seam — every one of them reads or writes a file,
# narrows an untyped value by class, or reads bytes, none of which the
# shared runtime does. Loaded from both boot.rb files (spinel and the
# CRuby overlay), after action_controller so the `polymorphic_url`
# reopen below wins that file's raising definition.
#
# The layout is Rails' own `ActiveStorage::Service::DiskService`:
# `<root>/<key[0,2]>/<key[2,2]>/<key>`, so a `storage/` volume this
# tree wrote can be read by a Rails process pointed at the same
# database, and vice versa. `root` is `storage/files` (campfire's
# production `config/storage.yml`) and `tmp/storage` under RAILS_ENV=
# test, as Rails' generated storage.yml has it — the test harness cleans
# `tmp/storage` between files rather than between tests, which is also
# what Rails does.
