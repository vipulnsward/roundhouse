# Independent of Minitest entirely: insulates the emit from matz-
# analyzer changes around how spinel infers the Minitest::Test reopen

# One-time global setup: configure the Db primitive surface (cruby
# shim under stock CRuby — `runtime/spinel/db.rb` wraps the sqlite3
# gem; FFI shim under spinel-compiled binaries once matz/spinel#405
# lands), load the schema via Db.exec, and wire `ActiveRecord.adapter`
# to `SqliteAdapter`.
#
# Wiring the adapter matches the per-target test harnesses (crystal
# `test_helper.cr`, typescript) and the blog's `main.rb`. The generic AR
# class methods (`count`/`exists?`/`where`) delegate to
# `ActiveRecord.adapter` rather than per-model `_adapter_*` primitives, so
# their base bodies must type-check against a real adapter under spinel
# AOT — which compiles every method, including ones a per-model override
# shadows. CRuby tolerated an unwired (nil) adapter because it never
# compiles a dead base method; spinel does, and `ActiveRecord.adapter`
# resolved to its nil default makes `_adapter_count` emit a `nil` from an
# `Integer`-typed function (incompatible-pointer C error). SqliteAdapter
# shares the single Db configured here, so no separate `.configure` is
# needed.
#
# Per-test isolation comes from `SchemaSetup.reset!` calling each
# model's `_adapter_truncate`. Each model's lowered class has its
# own truncate primitive (per-table DELETE).
#
# ONE database, SHARED by every connection in the pool, and a FILE — the
# shape Rails tests against (`storage/test.sqlite3`, `timeout: 5000`).
#
# Not a bare `:memory:`: that is a database PER CONNECTION, and every Db
# shim opens a pool of them — the unleased path a test runs on used the
# first, and any `Db.with_connection` on another thread leased a
# different, empty one ("no such table" from the web-push pool's
# invalidation thread, the first thing in the suite to take a lease of
# its own).
#
# And not SQLite's shared-cache memory URI (`file::memory:?cache=shared`),
# which this ran on until 2026-09-17. Shared cache trades the file
# database's locking for TABLE locks that never wait: a read cursor open
# on `accounts` on one connection makes an INSERT into `accounts` on
# another fail at once with SQLITE_LOCKED, `busy_timeout` notwithstanding.
# campfire's first-run race test — five threads posting the first
# account together, written to prove the singleton guard — then died on
# the lock instead of reaching the guard, ~40% of runs on a Mac (11/20,
# 12/20, 16/20 measured) and one run in eight on the Linux box. Under a
# file database the writers wait, as they do in Rails, and the guard
# answers: 20/20. Every shim opens a plain path with WAL, and
# `busy_timeout` is stated in each.
#
# Named by the test binary and deleted before it is opened: fresh every
# run, one file per test file (so a parallel sweep never shares one),
# and bounded — a rerun overwrites, never accumulates. The schema is

# ── Dom primitive surface (the assert_select substrate) ────────────
#
# The HTML-query contract `assert_select` lowers to, shared in shape
# across every target (Ruby/TS/Python/Rust/Elixir/… — see the cross-
# target contract in runtime/spinel/test/test_helper.rbs). This is the
# historical substring matcher dressed as a Dom: `select` fabricates
# one synthetic node — the whole document body — per fragment
# occurrence, and `text` returns that node verbatim. So presence,
# `minimum:`, and content checks all degrade to exactly the pre-
# contract behavior. The upgrade path is to swap these three methods
# for a Nokogiri-backed (CRuby) / lexbor-FFI (spinel-AOT) engine —
# real nodes, real CSS selectors — touching only this module; the
# assert_select call site and every other target stay put.
#
# `parse`/`select`/`text` take/return Strings in the stub (doc and node
# are both "the html"). A real engine keeps the same method set but
# returns opaque tree/node handles — the contract is the surface, not
# the handle shape.

  #
  # The scan is anchor-then-verify. `fragment_for` picks ONE part of the
  # compound selector as a cheap way to enumerate candidate positions;
  # every part is then checked against the START TAG the candidate sits
  # in, which is recovered by walking back to its `<`. That walk is what

# records and returns WITHOUT dispatching (see `ActiveJob::ENQUEUE_ONLY`
# — switched on at the bottom of this file). The app itself still runs
# its jobs inline; only the suite enqueues. That is not a convenience:
# campfire's `Message` fires `Room::PushMessageJob.perform_later` from
# an `after_create_commit`, so under inline dispatch every message a
# FIXTURE loads would run the pusher, and the suite would die in its
# unresolvable nested join before a single assertion ran. Rails' suite
# never reaches that code for exactly this reason.
#
# `ActiveJob::PERFORMED` is the queue-inspection seam, appended by the
# `perform_later` wrapper `lower::job_class_side` synthesizes — a log of
# NAMES rather than a queue of arguments, which is what
# `assert_enqueued_with` documents its narrower check against.
#
# `only:` is an ARRAY OF CLASS NAMES, empty for "any". The test source
# writes classes (`only: Bot::WebhookJob`); `lower::job_test_only`
# rewrites them, because a class is not a first-class value on the
# strict targets.

    # `{"channel":"PresenceChannel","room_id":"5"}` — and hands it to
    # `ActionCable::Channel.build`, the same generated factory
    # `Cable.subscribe` resolves a client's frame through, over the same
    # connection class `Cable.identify` builds. So a test here asks the
    # runtime the question a browser would, and a channel confirmed
    # here is one the server would confirm; the harness adds nothing a
    # frame could not have said. Rails' own `TestCase` builds the
    # channel with `channel_class.new(connection, identifier, params)`
    # and mixes a `ChannelStub` in for `confirmed?`/`rejected?`/
    # `streams`; those three live on `Channel::Base` here, because the

    # macro's or the test class's name minus `Test`, as Rails resolves

    # read as Strings on every lane (`Parameters` in action_cable.rb —

  # `Session < ApplicationRecord` lost `Session.create!` to
  # `ActionDispatch::Session`, which answers no such method. Ruby
  # searches an included module's namespace before top level, so the
  # app's own class cannot win. `Flash`, `Request` and `Cookies` are
  # the same hazard waiting for the app that names one. Two qualified
  # references are cheaper than that.

  # `headers:` carries RAW CGI env keys, the way Rails' integration
  # tests do — `"REMOTE_ADDR" => "203.0.113.1"`, `"HTTP_USER_AGENT" =>
  # "Mozilla/5.0"`. Rails also accepts wire-shaped names ("Content-Type")
  # and normalizes them; campfire only ever writes the env shape, and
  # normalizing would need a rule table nothing in the corpus exercises,
  # so the keys go through verbatim onto the env the dispatch builds.
  # Any test asserting on a request-derived value the app reads —
  # `reject_banned_ip`'s `request.remote_ip`, a push subscription's
  # `request.user_agent` — needs this to reach the env, not just the
  # params.
  #
  # `env:` is Rails' OTHER spelling of the same thing and campfire
  # writes both (`get new_session_url, env: { "HTTP_USER_AGENT" => … }`
  # in `sessions_controller_test`). In Rails the two differ only in
  # normalization — `headers:` accepts wire-shaped names and rewrites
  # them, `env:` is raw — and since this harness takes `headers:` RAW
  # already, they are the same hash here. Merged with `env:` last, so a
  # test naming a key in both gets the rawer one, which is Rails'
  # order too.
  #
  # `as: :json` is Rails' request ENCODER: the params travel as a JSON
  # body under `Content-Type: application/json`, and the app reads

  # on the way in — and sets the content type and format the encoder

  # `assert_select` over the Dom primitive surface (defined above). The
  # stub Dom is a substring matcher, so this is NOT yet a real CSS
  # engine — but the call shape is the real one: select nodes, assert
  # the set is non-empty, and (for the content form) assert a matched
  # node's text contains the expected string. Forms exercised by real-
  # blog: `assert_select("h1", "Articles")`, `assert_select("form")`,
  # `assert_select("#comments .p-4", minimum: 1)`, and the block form
  # `assert_select("#articles") { … }`.
  #
  # `minimum:`/`maximum:` and a NON-ZERO `count:` degrade to a presence
  # check (the pre-contract behavior; real-blog only passes `minimum:
  # 1`, for which presence is exact). The block runs against the same
  # body — no real scoping until a real engine lands. `opts` is retained
  # in the signature for call-shape compatibility.
  #
  # `count: 0` IS honored, and the history of that is worth keeping.
  # Honoring the whole option was tried and backed out (2026-08-22,
  # measured on campfire: 189/240 -> 184/240) because it needed TWO
  # things the stub did not have:
  #
  #   * ELEMENT counting. `Dom.select` fabricated one node per SUBSTRING
  #     occurrence, so `.message` (fragment `message"`) counted every
  #     attribute value ending in `message`. searches_controller's two
  #     `count: 0` assertions went red against a correct empty page.
  #   * BLOCK SCOPING. `assert_select "template", count: 1` inside
  #     `assert_select "turbo-stream[action='append']" do … end` asks
  #     "one template IN THIS ELEMENT". The block re-scans the whole
  #     body, which holds two.
  #
  # The FIRST of those is now fixed — `Dom.select` matches whole class
  # tokens on a real start tag — which is what makes `count: 0`
  # separable from the rest of the option: absence is a question about
  # the SELECTOR, and the selector is now answered exactly. Counting to
  # a number above zero still is not, because that is the scoping
  # problem, and scoping is the real engine's job.
  #
  # One deliberate divergence: a content constraint beside `count: 0`
  # (`assert_select "h1", text: /…/, count: 0`) is IGNORED, so the
  # assertion reads "no such element" rather than Rails' "no such
  # element WITH THIS TEXT". Narrowing it is not available here —
  # `Dom.text` answers the whole document for every node — and of the
  # two available readings, the strict one fails loudly where the loose
  # one passed vacuously.
  # Rails overloads the first parameter: `assert_select(selector, …)`
  # scopes to the last response, `assert_select(root, selector, …)`
  # scopes to a node you already have. campfire's `turbo_test_helper`
  # uses the second form —
  #
  #   assert_select(Nokogiri::HTML.fragment(streams), "turbo-stream[…]")
  #
  # — over the broadcasts it pulled off the pubsub queue, which are not
  # in any response body. Without it the assertion searched the LAST
  # RESPONSE for a fragment that was never rendered into one.
  #
  # `to_s` rather than `to_html` on the root: a Nokogiri fragment
  # answers the same markup for both, and `to_s` is a method every
  # target can compile on a value it cannot type. The root arrives
  # untyped by construction — it is whatever HTML library the app's own
