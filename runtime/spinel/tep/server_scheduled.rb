# Tep::Server::Scheduled -- Falcon-shape fiber-per-connection HTTP
# server, built on Tep::Scheduler + sp_net non-blocking accept/recv.
#
# THE MEASUREMENT LANE. Tep::Server::Threaded (a green thread per
# connection) replaced this server on 2026-09-01; this file came back on
# 2026-09-03 so the two designs can be measured on ONE binary, differing
# only in the environment: `TEP_SERVER=fiber` selects it (scaffold/main.rb),
# `SPINEL_WORKERS` is irrelevant to it (every fiber runs on the main
# thread). It serves the HTTP keep-alive path only: a WebSocket upgrade
# is refused with a 501 (its recv loop belongs on a parked green thread,
# and here it would hold every other connection), and the per-request
# state the threaded server keeps in Thread.current is shared by all
# fibers on the main thread -- correct while a request runs from start to
# finish without yielding, which a GET does; so the bench pages run it and
# the campfire gates do not. matz/spinel#4306 is the question it answers.
#
# Why this exists
# ---------------
# The default Tep::Server (in server.rb) is prefork + blocking per
# worker -- N workers <=> N concurrent connections. WebSockets and
# slow keep-alive clients tie up a worker for the full connection
# duration, so the prefork pool's effective concurrency degrades
# to N regardless of actual CPU work. The scheduled variant accepts
# in a fiber, spawns one fiber per accepted connection, and parks
# all I/O on Tep::Scheduler.io_wait -- N workers serve M >> N
# concurrent connections, bounded only by per-fiber memory.
#
# Fiber bodies use ordinary closure capture for sfd / client now
# (matz/spinel#564 + #1007 both closed; the heap-cell-reset fix
# in spinel commit 48594d6 lets multi-method capture chains lower
# correctly). cmeths still preferred for accept_loop /
# handle_connection so the bodies read cleanly without per-instance
# state, but the per-connection fd flows through closure capture,
# not the earlier `Tep::APP.pending_*` stash + pause(0) handoff.
