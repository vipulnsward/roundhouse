# Tep::Server::Threaded -- a green thread per connection.
#
# The connection is a `Thread`. spinel's Thread is a green thread on an
# M:N scheduler: every `recv` and `write` in sp_net parks the thread on
# EAGAIN and frees its OS worker, `sleep` parks, and the timed waits
# below park with a deadline (matz/spinel#4262). So a held-open
# WebSocket costs one small stack, a slow subscriber stalls only its own
# writer, and the workers run other connections' Ruby in parallel.
#
# This replaces Tep::Server::Scheduled, a fiber-per-connection server
# over a Ruby poll loop. That design had a wall in C below it -- a
# blocking write inside the net layer that no Ruby scheduler could see
# -- and a poll set rebuilt every tick. Both now belong to the runtime's
# monitor thread, which is the point of building on `Thread`.
#
# Client fds stay NON-BLOCKING: sp_net parks only on EAGAIN, so a
# blocking fd would pin the OS worker in the syscall instead. Timed
# waits go through one `IO.for_fd` wrapper per connection (a dup, closed
# with the connection), because a raw fd has no `wait_readable`.
#
# OS WORKERS: the runtime's autodetected count, one per core; an operator
# sets `SPINEL_WORKERS=N`. This server ran on ONE worker first (declared
# on main.rb's first line, 14e80658 -> 1db97994) while the multi-worker
# collector had two open gaps -- matz/spinel#4272, the boxed proc channel
# `_sp_proc_poly_ret/_args` being per-worker TLS the stop-the-world
# barrier never published, so a stale slot on an idle worker named an
# object another worker's collection had freed; and the per-class pool
# recycle's plain push under the PARALLEL sweep -- found with a 16-core
# browser loop (4 of 7 runs dead in sp_StrArray_scan under the mark),
# SPINEL_GC_VERIFY + GC_STRESS, and a TSan build. Both merged upstream
# 2026-09-02 (PRs #4273, #4274). The declaration was lifted on that
# runtime with the same loop: 10 of 10 runs alive, the process at 9 OS
# threads under the browser's load (3 idle); the docs ledger
# (docs/pipeline/runtime.md, "The threaded binary dies on more than one
# OS worker") carries the evidence.
#
# AN fd NUMBER IS NOT A CONNECTION. The one symptom that survived the
# collector fixes was ours: the ping thread and the broadcast fan-out
# wrote to `fd` as an Integer, and a closed socket's number goes to the
# next accept, so a write that "only fails when the fd is closed" landed
# in a stranger's socket -- a ping frame ahead of an asset's HTTP
# response, ahead of a new cable's 101, or interleaved with another
# thread's frame. The traced loop showed it in one run (EOF on fd 40 at
# trace line 138, `ping fd=40 r=0` at 184, the next welcome on 40 at
# 185). Every write now goes through the connection's
# Tep::WebSocket::Driver#write_frame under its lock, and this server
# RETIRES the driver after the recv loop and BEFORE closing the fd
# (write_response's upgrade branch). Hold an fd only through the object
# that owns it. With that fix the loop is 10 of 10 green with no
# handshake error; the unfixed tree wrote into a reused number 5 times
# across 4 of its 10 runs (a traced ping after the socket's EOF, r=0).
