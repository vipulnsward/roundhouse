  # An exception out of the app is ONE request's failure, not the
  # server's. Both server variants call `dispatch` bare, so anything the
  # handler raised unwound through the connection loop and killed the
  # process: every later request on every later connection got a refused
  # socket, and a sweep read one defect as a hundred. Rack servers have
  # always contained this (Puma logs the exception and answers 500 —
  # verified against the CRuby tree, where the next request still
  # served); tep is the peer of Puma here and owed the same contract.
  #
  # Logged in Puma's shape — one line, verb and path, class and message
  # — because the operator's next question is always "which request?".
  # stderr, not stdout: the access banner owns stdout, and a crash
  # report interleaved into it is the thing you grep past.
  #
  # THE FRAMES ARE THE POINT WHEN THE APP IS AOT-COMPILED. A 500 from
  # the emitted binary used to be one line with no site, so locating it
  # meant re-deriving the call path by reading the emit — the summary
  # line names the request, and nothing names the statement. Spinel
  # captures a native backtrace under `spin build --debug`
  # (`SPIN_DEBUG=1`), and without this it captured one nobody printed.
  #
  # `backtrace` answers nil for an exception that was never raised and
  # an EMPTY array on a release build (spinel's `backtrace_symbols` is
  # a no-op stub unless `--debug`), so both are normal and neither is
  # worth a line. The summary keeps Puma's shape whatever happens.
