# Tep::App -- per-process singleton holding the fan-out registries the
# connection threads share.
#
# This is a heavily trimmed vendoring of upstream tep's lib/tep/app.rb.
# Upstream's App also carries the router, filter slots, auth/oauth,
# presence, PG pub/sub, asset bodies, and session handling, and its
# `dispatch` walks that whole pipeline. Roundhouse dispatches through
# its own `Main.dispatch` (see scaffold/main.rb), so this copy keeps
# only what Tep::Broadcast and Cable read off `Tep::APP`, plus a
# `dispatch` that leases a connection and delegates to the roundhouse
# app.
#
# Connections are green threads (Tep::Server::Threaded), so the two
# registries here are shared between threads and each has a lock; every
# reader and writer takes it (tep/broadcast.rb, cable.rb).

    # a topic with an output fd + delivery mode.

    # walks the list every Cable::PING_INTERVAL. Here rather than in
    # Cable for the reason `cable_identifiers` is: a module-level

    # upgrade is dispatched under this lease too; the socket's recv loop
    # runs after the response and outside it, as before.
