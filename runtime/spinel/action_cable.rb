# ActionCable — the spinel-subset sibling of the CRuby overlay's
# `ruby_overlay/runtime/action_cable.rb`.
#
# Same two surfaces as the overlay, at opposite ends of the same wire:
#
# 1. `ActionCable.server.broadcast(stream, payload)` — the low-level
#    publish model code calls directly. NOT the Turbo Stream family
#    (`broadcast_append_to` and friends, which lower onto
#    `Broadcasts.append`): those ship an HTML fragment for Turbo to
#    splice into the DOM, this ships an arbitrary payload for the app's
#    own channel JS to read. campfire uses both one line apart — a new
#    message rides Turbo, the unread-room badge beside it rides this.
#
# 2. `Channel::Base` / `Connection::Base` — what an app's own
#    `app/channels/*.rb` subclasses. Channels are ingested as ordinary
#    app classes, so these exist to make those files COMPILE, and to
#    carry the half of a channel that works with no socket at all:
#    `UnreadRoomsChannel.stream_name_for(user_id)` is a pure class
#    method, and the model doing the broadcasting is what calls it.
#
# WHERE THIS DIVERGES FROM THE OVERLAY, and why:
#
# * **The payload is rendered to JSON text here, not carried as a Hash.**
#   The overlay hands a Ruby Hash the whole way to `Cable::Registry
#   .deliver` and lets it serialize. A strict target has no such lane: a
#   `payload` parameter that must hold `{room_id: 1}` and `{roomId: 1}`
#   and whatever the next app writes is exactly the untyped bag the
#   emitter cannot lower. So the Hash is serialized at the boundary —
#   `Server#broadcast` takes it, `payload_json` renders it once, and
#   everything downstream carries String. `Cable.publish_raw` splices
#   that text UNQUOTED into the envelope's `message` field, which is what
#   keeps the shape a JSON object rather than a JSON string.
#
# * **`Broadcasts::LOG` therefore records the rendered text**, where the
#   overlay records the Hash. Both entries answer the question
#   `assert_broadcasts` asks — did a raw publish happen on this stream —
#   and the `action: :message` key still tells the two kinds of entry
#   apart. A reader that inspects `payload` gets text on this target and
#   a Hash on CRuby; that divergence is in docs/pipeline/runtime.md.
#
# SUBSCRIPTION DISPATCH: a subscribe frame is routed to the channel it
# NAMES through `Channel.build` below (one generated arm per app
# channel), `subscribed` runs and the streams it asked for are
# registered — `Cable.subscribe` on the server, `Channel::TestCase
# #subscribe` in the emitted harness, both through the same factory.
# The bundled `json` (spinel: the native binding to sp_json.c, activated
# by this require; CRuby: the stdlib) parses subscribe frames and quotes
# envelope fields. The flat-key decoder this glue used to carry is gone.

    # PARSED PER READ, COERCED AT THE BOUNDARY. An identifier is
    # `{"channel":"RoomChannel","room_id":5}`: heterogeneous values
    # under keys only the app knows, which is the untyped bag this
    # pipeline has nowhere to put. `JSON.parse` hands it back as one
    # boxed value and every read coerces what it takes out (`to_s`), so
    # nothing downstream widens; a channel only ever asks for the keys
    # it names — campfire's seven ask for `signed_stream_name` and
    # `room_id` — so nothing keeps the object around.
    #
    # A STRING EVERY TIME, INCLUDING FOR A NUMBER. `RoomChannel` does
    # `Room.find_by(id: params[:room_id])` and the client writes
    # `{"room_id":5}` — a JSON number. Answering it as its digits is
    # what makes the find work: the column is an integer and the
    # adapter casts a numeric string, where a Ruby Integer and a Ruby
    # String cannot both come out of one slot on a strict target.
    # Rails' own `params` is string-valued for the same reason one hop
    # earlier (a query string has no types), so this is the Rails
    # answer rather than a concession.
    #
    # "" for a key the identifier does not carry, which is what a
    # channel testing `if params[:signed_stream_name]` needs — a nil
    # would make the slot nullable for every reader.

    # the class itself cannot be reached by `const_get` on a target that
    # resolves every call statically. An eager arm is the whole answer.

    # THE DEFAULT ARM IS NOT A STUB. An app with no
    # `app/channels/application_cable/connection.rb` — the blog fixture —
    # connects ANONYMOUSLY, and must: Turbo Stream fan-out predates
    # identity and has to keep working for an app that never asked for
    # it. `Base#connect` is a no-op and its `current_user` is nil, so a
    # channel that needs a user fails on nil rather than silently
    # getting somebody else's.
    #
    # NO REQUIRE, deliberately: this is a method BODY reference, and
    # `app/models.rb` (boot.rb, well before any request) has loaded the
    # class by the time a handshake arrives. Requiring it here would
    # invert the load order — `ApplicationCable::Connection`'s superclass
    # is `ActionCable::Connection::Base`, a LOAD-time reference into this
