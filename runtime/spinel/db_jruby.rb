# `db_cruby.rb` (the CRuby/`sqlite3`-gem shim) and `db.rb` (the spinel
# FFI shim), but backed by JDBC: the `sqlite3` gem is a C extension with
# no JRuby build, so JRuby talks to SQLite through the Xerial
# `sqlite-jdbc` driver (the `jdbc-sqlite3` gem) over `java.sql`.
#
# API (identical to db_cruby.rb — `sqlite_adapter.rb` and the
# lowerer-emitted `_adapter_*` methods are unchanged across all shims):
#
#   Db.configure(path)         — open a database (":memory:" for tests)
#   Db.close                   — close all connections
#   Db.exec(sql)               — run DDL / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
#   Db.prepare(sql)            — prepare a SELECT, returns a stmt handle
#   Db.step?(stmt)             — advance, returns true if a row arrived
#   Db.column_int(stmt, i)     — read int column at zero-based index
#   Db.column_text(stmt, i)    — read text column at zero-based index
#   Db.column_count(stmt)      — number of columns in the prepared row
#   Db.column_name(stmt, i)    — name of column at zero-based index
#   Db.finalize(stmt)          — release the prepared stmt
#   Db.last_insert_rowid       — id of the last INSERTed row
#   Db.changes                 — affected-row count of the last statement
#
# THREAD-SAFETY: JRuby has no GVL, so Puma's worker threads run truly in
# parallel. db_cruby.rb once keyed statement handles into a single global
# `@rows` hash with a shared `@next_id` counter — safe only under CRuby's
# GVL, and it raced here and under TruffleRuby until it adopted this
# file's design. Here the stmt handle is an opaque `Stmt` wrapper object
# returned straight from `prepare`; callers only ever pass it back to
# `Db.*` (verified against `sqlite_adapter.rb`), so there is no shared
# mutable handle table to race on. The per-connection prepared-statement cache lives on the
# leased `Conn` (one thread at a time via `with_connection`), so it needs
# no lock either — same invariant db_cruby.rb relies on.
#
# JDBC notes: column indices are 1-based (we add 1 to the zero-based
# contract index). `column_count`/`column_name` read the
# PreparedStatement's metadata, which the sqlite-jdbc driver resolves at
# prepare time — `sqlite_adapter.rb` calls `column_count` before the
# first `step?`, so we must not depend on a ResultSet existing yet.
