# Puma loads this file, mounts the returned app, and serves HTTP/1.1.
# Each request goes Rack env → Main.run_rack → Rack tuple, directly: a
# Rack env already carries the CGI-style keys dispatch reads
# (REQUEST_METHOD / PATH_INFO / QUERY_STRING / CONTENT_* / HTTP_COOKIE)
# plus `rack.input`, so there is no env remap, and `run_rack` builds the
# `[status, headers, [body]]` tuple itself rather than serializing a CGI
# byte stream that this file would then re-parse. (The CGI byte form is
# still produced by `Main.run` for the one-shot script path and the
# tests; it is just not on the serving hot path.)

  # was handled out-of-band" — Puma stops touching the connection.

  # `upgrade` runs the app's `ApplicationCable::Connection#connect`
  # first and answers nil when the app rejected the handshake, so an
  # unauthenticated client gets a 401 on an intact Rack connection
  # rather than a socket that opens and then goes quiet. It needs a DB
  # handle for the same reason a request does — campfire's `connect`
  # loads a `Session` — so it leases one the same way.
  #
  # The Origin is checked before any of that, as Action Cable orders it
