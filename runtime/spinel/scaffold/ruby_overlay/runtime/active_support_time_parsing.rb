# Native date-only parsing plus UTC-safe timestamp parsing/stamping.
#
# Dates store as YYYY-MM-DD, with no time or zone. Separately,
# Rails' sqlite3 adapter stores DateTime/Time columns as bare
# `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS[.ffffff]` TEXT with no zone marker — always
# implicitly UTC. Ruby's stdlib `Time.parse`, when a string carries no
# zone marker, defaults to the *system's local zone* instead (a
# well-known gotcha) — silently shifting every such value by the host's
# UTC offset. `apply_datetime_lowering`'s synthesized column reader
# calls `parse_db_time` instead of bare `Time.parse` so parsing is
# correct regardless of the machine's `TZ`. A string that already
# carries an explicit zone (an API-supplied value, or a timestamp
# written by a pre-`db_now` roundhouse build, which appended "Z") is
# left alone — that marker is authoritative and must not be overridden.
#
# Nil-safe: a NULL / unset column hydrates as `nil` or `""` (the
# adapter's `column_text` maps SQL NULL to `""`), and the synthesized
# reader calls this unguarded — absent storage must yield `nil`, not an
# ArgumentError out of `Time.parse("")`.
# Stdlib `time` for `Time.parse`. Safe to require here: this file is
# CRuby/JRuby-overlay-only (never part of the spinel AOT require walk),
# and requiring it locally keeps every bootstrap that chains this file
# (main.rb, or test_helper via runtime/db.rb) self-sufficient.

  # ---- THE TEST CLOCK ------------------------------------------------
  #
  # `ActiveSupport.now` is the ONE time read in this runtime. Every
  # other one calls it — `db_now` below, `Duration#ago`/`#from_now`
  # beside it — so `travel_to` in the test harness can move the clock
  # for the whole app with a single write, and a model does not have to
  # know it is under test.
  #
  # ActiveSupport's own `TimeHelpers` do this by stubbing `Time.now`,
  # which needs a reopened built-in; the shared runtime cannot reopen
  # one, and spinel AOT cannot stub at all. A module function every
  # caller already routes through is the same seam without either.
  #
  # An ARRAY, not a module ivar: `TRANSPORTS` in broadcasts.rb holds
  # mutable module state the same way, and the literal `[0]` is what
  # pins the element type for spinel.
  #
  # PRODUCTION IS ZERO. Nothing outside the harness ever calls
  # `travel`, so `now` is `Time.now` plus a constant-folded 0.
