# frozen_string_literal: true

# CRuby overlay: a REAL in-memory cache store behind `Rails.cache`,
# replacing the shared runtime's no-op (runtime/rails.rb — correct but
# recomputes every fetch). Lobsters caches its heaviest work through
# Rails.cache (`users_tree_*` 24h, front-page `stories *` 45s, `story *`
# 60s, per-user `unread_replies` 2min), so a no-op store isn't a missing
# optimization, it's a different program than the one Rails runs.
#
# Semantics mirror ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore:
#   * DupCoder: bare Strings are dup'd on write AND read (mutation-safe
#     without Marshal cost — cached page fragments are big strings);
#     everything else Marshal round-trips so each hit gets a fresh object
#     graph (a cached AR row mutated by one request must not leak into
#     the next).
#   * `expires_in:` accepts Integer seconds or ActiveSupport::Duration
#     (both appear in lobsters); expiry checked lazily on read.
#
# Process-local by design: the CRuby serving shape is one process (Puma
# workers=0), matching MemoryStore's own scope. Thread-safety via a
# single Mutex, as MemoryStore does.
#
# CRuby-only (overlay, not runtime/ruby): Marshal/Mutex/Time-based
# eviction are exactly the is_a?-dispatching dynamic shapes the shared
# runtime's typing bar excludes; other targets keep the no-op until
# their lobsters turn.
#
# TWO STORES ANSWER `Rails.cache`, and every method the compiler emits
# a call to has to exist on BOTH — this one and the shared runtime's
# `Rails::Cache`. `read_str`/`write_str` landed on the shared one first
# and every campfire page 500'd here with `undefined method 'read_str'
# for an instance of Rails::MemoryStore`, which is the cache's version
# of the dual-runtime parity rule the Db shims carry
# ([[feedback_dual_runtime_parity]]).

    # Thin delegates, as `fetch_str` above is — `write` still dups the
    # String into the store. `read_str` does NOT dup on the way out:
    # a view's `<% cache %>` only appends the hit (`io << hit`), and a
    # campfire room page is ~40 message fragments. DupCoder's read-side
    # copy was 40 extra 2–5 KB allocations per wrk GET that shared
    # nothing with mutation safety, because the stored copy is already
    # isolated by the write-side dup. A non-String under that key is a
