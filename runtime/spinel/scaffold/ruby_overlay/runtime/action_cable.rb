# ActionCable — the framework surface an app's OWN channels sit on, plus
# the low-level publish API that model code calls directly.
#
# Two surfaces, at opposite ends of the same wire.
#
# 1. `ActionCable.server.broadcast(stream, payload)`. This is NOT the
#    Turbo Stream family (`broadcast_append_to` and friends, which lower
#    onto `Broadcasts.append`): those ship an HTML fragment for Turbo to
#    splice into the DOM, this ships an arbitrary payload for the app's
#    own channel JS to read. campfire uses both, one line apart — a new
#    message rides Turbo, the unread-room badge beside it rides this.
#
#    The payload stays a Ruby Hash the whole way to
#    `Cable::Registry.deliver`, and that is what makes the envelope right.
#    Action Cable's `message` field carries the VALUE, so `{roomId: 1}`
#    has to arrive as a JSON object; pre-serializing it to a String here
#    would ship `"message":"{\"roomId\":1}"` — valid JSON, wrong shape,
#    and wrong in the silent way, because `JSON.generate` accepts either
#    happily and only the browser notices.
#
# 2. `Channel::Base` / `Connection::Base` — what `app/channels/*.rb`
#    subclasses. Channels are ingested as ordinary app classes, so these
#    exist to make those files LOAD, and to carry the half of a channel
#    that works with no socket at all: `UnreadRoomsChannel
#    .stream_name_for(user_id)` is a pure class method, and the model
#    doing the broadcasting is what calls it.
#
# SUBSCRIPTION DISPATCH, and the shape of it. A subscribe frame carries
# an identifier naming a channel (`{"channel":"RoomMessagesChannel",
# "signed_stream_name":"…"}`); `Cable::Dispatch` looks the class up in
# `Channel::Base::REGISTRY`, instantiates it against this connection and
# those params, and runs the app's own `subscribed`. Whatever that method
# asked for through `stream_from`/`stream_for` is what gets registered —
# and if it called `reject`, nothing is.
#
# BY REGISTRY, NOT BY `const_get`. The channel name is a string off the
# wire. Rails resolves it with `safe_constantize` and then checks the
# result descends from `Channel::Base`; here the only names that resolve
# are the ones that registered themselves by being defined, so a crafted
# identifier cannot reach a constant that is not a channel in the first
# place. It is also the rule this runtime already follows: a name
# computed at runtime is not statically resolvable, and eight of the
# targets have no way to honour one.
#
# WHAT THIS BUYS, in one line: the app's authorization runs. campfire
# prepends `RoomStreamsAreAuthorized` onto `Turbo::StreamsChannel` so the
# stock channel refuses `:messages` streams, leaving
# `RoomMessagesChannel` — which checks membership — as the only door onto
# them. Neither ran while subscribes bypassed channels entirely.
#
# CRuby/JRuby only, like the `cable.rb` it publishes through. Spinel's
# Action Cable rides tep and is a separate substrate.

module ActionCable
  # The `ActionCable.server` singleton. Only `broadcast` is modeled;
  # `server.config`'s one reachable reader (`mount_path`) is folded to
  # its literal at compile time by `lower::config_reader`, so nothing
  # asks for it here.
  class Server
    # `stream` is the name a subscriber gave (`user_7_unreads`);
    # `payload` is whatever the app wants delivered under `message`.
    #
    # Reaching `Broadcasts::TRANSPORTS` directly rather than adding a
    # `Broadcasts.publish` to broadcasts.rb is deliberate: that file is
    # SHARED with spinel, which compiles it whole. A `payload` parameter
    # with no spinel caller types as int and then poisons the
    # `broadcast(String, String)` dispatch below it — the same trap
    # `SeedTransport` exists to document. This file is overlay-only, so
    # it can hand a Hash across that seam.
    #
    # RECORDED IN `Broadcasts::LOG`, and this file used to carry the
    # opposite conclusion: that LOG's `action`/`target`/`html` shape is
    # the turbo-FRAGMENT contract and a raw payload is not a fragment.
    # True about the shape, wrong about the log. `ActionCable::TestHelper
    # #assert_broadcasts` reads LOG and exists precisely to count raw
    # publishes on an app-named stream — Rails' own reads the test
    # adapter's pubsub queue, which carries whatever was published. With
    # only the dispatch here, campfire's "creating a message broadcasts
    # unread room to each member" counted 0 against a broadcast that had
    # in fact happened: the two halves of the harness were never joined.
    #
    # Logged under `payload:` rather than squeezed into `html:`, so an
    # entry never claims to be markup it is not. `action: :message` is
    # what tells the two kinds of entry apart; both readers of the log
    # (`capture_broadcasts_on`, `capture_turbo_stream_broadcasts`) filter
    # on `:stream` alone, so the extra key costs them nothing.
    #
    # LOG FIRST, then dispatch — the order `Broadcasts.record` uses, so a
    # transport that raises cannot lose the record of the attempt.
    #
    # `coder: nil` — Rails' "the payload is already encoded": campfire
    # encodes the unread notice once and hands every member the same
    # text (basecamp/once-campfire#292). This side carries the Hash, so
    # the text is read back into one and travels the same path.

    # `User#reset_remote_connections`.
    #
    # The set it selects is EMPTY here, and that is STILL a divergence
    # after subscription dispatch: connections now carry an identity and
    # channels read `current_user` off it, so the selection is finally
    # expressible — but nothing indexes live connections by user, and
    # `Cable::Reactor`'s table is keyed by socket. Closing it means an
    # index the reactor maintains on attach and drops on close, plus a
    # posted close for each hit.
    #
    # WHAT IT COSTS UNTIL THEN: a deactivated or banned user's open
    # socket keeps its subscriptions. The membership check in
    # `RoomMessagesChannel` runs at SUBSCRIBE time, which is exactly the
    # window campfire's own comment calls out ("revoking a membership
    # disconnects the user with reconnect: true, and the client then
    # replays its subscriptions") — the replay is now authorized, the
    # disconnect that forces it is not. Recorded in

      #
      # Ingest DROPS that line — it defines an accessor from a computed
      # name, which is the shape a strict target cannot compile — so the
      # emitted `ApplicationCable::Connection` has no `current_user=` of
      # its own and campfire's `connect` (`self.current_user =
      # find_verified_user`) is a `NoMethodError` on the first handshake.
      # Declared here instead, exactly as the spinel sibling declares it.
      # One name, because one is what `identified_by` has ever been given.
      #
      # This file used to answer it the other way, with a class method
      # that defined accessors from the argument list — correct for an
      # app whose `identified_by` call survived to the emit, and no app's
      # does. It was never reached, and the unit test did not notice
      # because its fixture was campfire's SOURCE, which still has the
      # line the emit does not. The fixture is the emitted form now.

      # THE COOKIE JAR OF THE HANDSHAKE REQUEST, and the whole reason
      # identity works: a WebSocket upgrade is an ordinary HTTP GET, so
      # it carries the same `Cookie:` header the app's controllers
      # authenticate from. campfire's `ApplicationCable::Connection`
      # includes `Authentication::SessionLookup` and calls
      # `cookies.signed[:session_token]` — the SAME method object its
      # controllers use. Handing it a real signed jar is what makes
      # `connect` the app's code rather than a reimplementation of it.

      # identifiers connects anonymously instead of erroring.
