# Library usage (from tests):
#   require_relative "main"
#   Main.run(env_hash, body_io, response_io)
#
# Script usage:
#   REQUEST_METHOD=GET PATH_INFO=/articles ruby main.rb

# SqliteAdapter is hoisted to top-level so the spinel-AOT compile
# can statically resolve the `SqliteAdapter` constant referenced
# from `Base#save` etc. via the adapter dispatcher. Under CRuby the
# require is harmless (the gem-backed shim only opens a DB on
# `configure`); under spinel the FFI-backed shim only emits when
# `runtime/sqlite_adapter` is in the require graph.
# The whole require chain (see boot.rb). Kept in its own file so
# `test/test_helper.rb` can load the app without loading this one,
# which starts a server.

# then start the scheduled Tep server with Main as the app. This file
# is the spinel-target main.rb — only consumed by `make build` →
# compiled native binary. The CRuby development path uses
# `ruby_overlay/main.rb` (Puma/Rack), which keeps the
# `__FILE__ == $PROGRAM_NAME` guard because under Puma the file is
# required, not invoked directly.

# Tep::Server::Threaded expects an app object with a `dispatch(req,
# res)` instance method. Wrap Main's class-method dispatch in a thin
# instance so spinel resolves @app.dispatch through normal user-class
# dispatch instead of trying to call a module method. The threaded
# server's cmeth handlers actually dispatch via Tep::APP.dispatch, so
# this delegates THERE: that is where the per-request connection lease
# (and with it the query cache and the statement-cache trim) lives, and
# a lease here as well would take two connections for one request.
