# Primitive Db surface — the layer that per-model adapter code sits on
# top of. The contract is database-agnostic; this file is the SQLite-via-
# the-cruby-`sqlite3`-gem implementation. Other backends (sqlite via
# spinel FFI, postgres via libpq, etc.) implement the same `module Db`
# in sibling files; a future dispatcher picks one at require time. See
# project_level_3_adapter_emit.md.
#
# API (the contract every Db shim must satisfy):
#
#   Db.configure(path)         — open a database (":memory:" for tests)
#   Db.close                   — close the database
#   Db.exec(sql)               — run DDL / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
#   Db.prepare(sql)            — prepare a SELECT, returns stmt handle
#   Db.step?(stmt)             — advance, returns true if a row arrived
#   Db.column_int(stmt, i)     — read int column at zero-based index
#   Db.column_text(stmt, i)    — read text column at zero-based index
#   Db.column_count(stmt)      — number of columns in the prepared row
#   Db.column_name(stmt, i)    — name of column at zero-based index
#   Db.finalize(stmt)          — release the prepared stmt
#   Db.bind_int/bind_text/bind_bool(stmt, i, v) — bind `?` param i (1-based)
#   Db.last_insert_rowid       — id of the last INSERTed row
#   Db.changes                 — affected-row count of the last statement
#
# Stmt handles are opaque — under spinel FFI they're real `:ptr` values;
# under this CRuby shim each is a per-call Hash carrying the statement and
# its most recently stepped row (so column_int / column_text can pick
# fields by index, mirroring the FFI column accessors). Callers only ever
# hand it back to `Db.*`. It used to be an Integer indexing a process-wide
# table with a shared counter, which only CRuby's GVL made safe: Puma's
# worker threads run in parallel under JRuby and TruffleRuby, two of them
# drew the same id, and one request read the other's (finalized, nil)
# row. Like db_jruby.rb, there is now no shared mutable handle state.
#
# Per-database SQL dialect differences (placeholder syntax, RETURNING vs
# last_insert_rowid, etc.) live inside each shim or in a separate dialect
# helper consulted by the lowerer at SQL-composition time.
#
# The Db primitive surface backs the lowerer-emitted Level-3 per-model
# `_adapter_*` methods. This file is the CRuby (gem-backed) variant;
# `db.rb` in the same directory is the FFI variant the Spinel-AOT
# target compiles against.

  # ── The write permit ──

  # SQLite allows one writer at a time. Left to itself, a second writer
  # gets SQLITE_BUSY and the busy handler retries on a timer, so writers
  # race: whoever retries at the right moment wins, and an unlucky one
  # loses again and again (the post-message tail). `exec` instead takes
  # the permit — for one statement in autocommit, or from BEGIN to
  # COMMIT/ROLLBACK — so writers in this process queue and go in turn.
  # The SQL still runs on the caller's own pooled connection; only the
  # permission is shared. A writer in another process still meets
  # SQLite's lock, and waits in `busy_handler_timeout`.
  #
  # The owner is a FIBER: BEGIN and COMMIT run on the same fiber, and a
  # different request on the same thread (Falcon) is a different fiber.
  #
  # THE WAIT IS BOUNDED. A transaction that starts a thread which writes
  # and then joins it would otherwise wait on itself forever. Before the
  # permit existed that case waited out SQLite's busy timeout and raised
  # SQLITE_BUSY; a hang is worse than that error. So after
  # `@write_permit_timeout` seconds a writer stops queueing and goes
  # straight to SQLite, which is exactly the old behaviour: it waits in
  # the busy handler and, if the lock never frees, raises BUSY.

  # ── The request read snapshot ──

  # Outside a transaction every SELECT is its own transaction, and each

  # check). Inside an open transaction the same point query skips that:
  # measured 0.93 -> 0.36 us through this gem on an M-series Mac, and
  # the once-campfire Ruby port measured 4.5 -> 0.2 us on Linux. It also
  # gives the request one consistent view of the database, which
  # autocommit does not.
  #
  # The dispatcher brackets a GET/HEAD with `read_snapshot_begin` /
  # `read_snapshot_end`. Nothing happens until the first `prepare`
  # opens a deferred BEGIN; the first `exec` (any write) ends it, and the
  # read after that opens a new one. The app is never asked to promise
  # its GET handlers don't write. A request in a transaction of its own
  # is left alone: `prepare` opens a snapshot only when the connection
  # is in autocommit.
  #
  # States: nil (off), :wanted (on, not open), :open (BEGIN issued by
  # us). Brackets nest — a test that dispatches from inside a lease, a
  # job drained inside a request — and only the outermost end closes
  # the snapshot.
  #
  # The state lives ON THE CONNECTION, not in fiber storage. A snapshot
  # is a property of one SQLite connection, and a connection is leased
  # to one holder at a time. Fiber storage is copied into every Thread
  # created inside the request, so a thread spawned during a GET would
