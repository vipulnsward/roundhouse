# Primitive Db surface — the layer that per-model adapter code sits on
# top of. The contract is database-agnostic; this file is the SQLite-via-
# the-cruby-`sqlite3`-gem implementation. Other backends (sqlite via
# spinel FFI, postgres via libpq, etc.) implement the same `module Db`
# in sibling files; a future dispatcher picks one at require time. See
# project_level_3_adapter_emit.md.
#
# API (the contract every Db shim must satisfy):
#
#   Db.configure(path)         — open a database (":memory:" for tests)
#   Db.close                   — close the database
#   Db.exec(sql)               — run DDL / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE
#   Db.prepare(sql)            — prepare a SELECT, returns stmt handle
#   Db.step?(stmt)             — advance, returns true if a row arrived
#   Db.column_int(stmt, i)     — read int column at zero-based index
#   Db.column_text(stmt, i)    — read text column at zero-based index
#   Db.column_count(stmt)      — number of columns in the prepared row
#   Db.column_name(stmt, i)    — name of column at zero-based index
#   Db.finalize(stmt)          — release the prepared stmt
#   Db.bind_int/bind_text/bind_bool(stmt, i, v) — bind `?` param i (1-based)
#   Db.last_insert_rowid       — id of the last INSERTed row
#   Db.changes                 — affected-row count of the last statement
#
# Stmt handles are opaque — under spinel FFI they're real `:ptr` values;
# under this CRuby shim each is a per-call Hash carrying the statement and
# its most recently stepped row (so column_int / column_text can pick
# fields by index, mirroring the FFI column accessors). Callers only ever
# hand it back to `Db.*`. It used to be an Integer indexing a process-wide
# table with a shared counter, which only CRuby's GVL made safe: Puma's
# worker threads run in parallel under JRuby and TruffleRuby, two of them
# drew the same id, and one request read the other's (finalized, nil)
# row. Like db_jruby.rb, there is now no shared mutable handle state.
#
# Per-database SQL dialect differences (placeholder syntax, RETURNING vs
# last_insert_rowid, etc.) live inside each shim or in a separate dialect
# helper consulted by the lowerer at SQL-composition time.
#
# The Db primitive surface backs the lowerer-emitted Level-3 per-model
# `_adapter_*` methods. This file is the CRuby (gem-backed) variant;
# `db.rb` in the same directory is the FFI variant the Spinel-AOT
# target compiles against.

  # SQL-value escaping primitives — lowerer-emitted code uses these to
  # inline literals (and runtime values when the placeholder-bind gate is
  # off). With the gate on, runtime values instead flow through `bind_*`
  # above; both shims (this gem-backed one and spinel-FFI) now support
  # binding. Inlining stays safe regardless since the lowerer controls
  # every string that flows here.
  # BYTES go out as a hex BLOB literal, `X'…'`. A NUL cannot ride a
  # quoted literal at all (it ends the SQL text: "unrecognized token"),
  # and a binary value stored as TEXT sorts before every BLOB, so a
  # `t.binary` column filled half one way and half the other orders
  # wrong. Bytes = BINARY-encoded and not plain ASCII (lobsters'
  # `[a, b, c].pack("CCC")` confidence_order), or any string holding a
  # NUL. An ASCII-only BINARY string stays text, as it always was.
