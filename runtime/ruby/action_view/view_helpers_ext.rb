    # which is an HTML5 PARSE followed by a text-content serialize, not
    # a `gsub(/<[^>]*>/, "")`. The difference is observable and was
    # measured against the real sanitizer, gem version 1.7.1:
    #
    #   "<b>Hi</b> &amp; <script>bad()</script>there"
    #                              -> "Hi &amp; bad()there"
    #   "a < b and c > d"          -> "a &lt; b and c &gt; d"
    #   "<b class=\"x>y\">z</b>"   -> "z"
    #   "unclosed <b tag"          -> "unclosed "
    #   "<>empty"                  -> "&lt;&gt;empty"
    #   "<!-- c -->visible"        -> "visible"
    #   "<!DOCTYPE html>x"         -> "x"
    #
    # So: a `<` that does not open a tag is TEXT and comes back
    # escaped; a `>` in a quoted attribute value does not end the tag;
    # an unterminated tag or comment swallows the rest of the input;
    # and the CONTENT of a dropped element survives (`bad()` above),
    # because only the tags are removed.
    #
    # DIVERGENCE, stated because it is invisible at the call site.

    # Rails' `sanitize` — the SAFE-LIST sanitizer, PORTED as a scanner
    # so every target compiles it. Until 2026-08-31 both entry points
    # below refused input containing markup, on the argument that a
    # scanner diverges from HTML5 tree construction exactly on malformed
    # input, which is what an attacker sends. That argument confused two
    # different obligations. FIDELITY to the gem does degrade on
    # malformed input, and the divergences are ledgered below. SAFETY
    # does not: this scanner never emits a tag it did not itself
    # serialize from the allow-list, never emits an attribute value it
    # did not itself quote and escape, and prunes what it cannot
    # classify — so its failure direction is more-escaped, not
    # less-sanitized. Meanwhile the refusal had a measured cost: every
    # Trix-composed campfire message body is HTML, the raise landed in
    # campfire's own `rescue Exception`, and every message rendered as
    # `""` — the chat app could not display a chat message.
    #
    # MEASURED against `Rails::HTML5::SafeListSanitizer`
    # (rails-html-sanitizer 1.7.1, loofah 2.25.2, the versions campfire
    # locks): `tests/shared_sanitize.rb` runs the probe corpus; on
    # well-formed input the two agree byte for byte. The known
    # divergences, each visible there:
    #
    #   * Tree construction. The gem parses and re-serializes, so it
    #     closes unclosed tags mid-document, splits mis-nested inline
    #     tags (`<b>a<p>b</b>c` → `<b>a</b><p><b>b</b>c</p>`), and
    #     re-homes a `</p>` whose `<p>` was auto-closed. This scanner
    #     keeps the source's own tag order, closing anything still open
    #     at end of input and dropping a close that nothing opened —
    #     the same answers on the simple malformed shapes, different
    #     (but well-formed, and drawn from the same allow-list) nesting
    #     on the pathological ones.
    #   * Entities in TEXT are kept as written, not decoded — the same
    #     policy `strip_tags` above ledgers (`&eacute;` here, `é`
    #     there; identical rendering). Likewise inside kept attribute
    #     values: the gem re-serializes `href="http&#58;//x"` as
    #     `href="http://x"`; this scanner keeps the reference. The URI
    #     PROTOCOL CHECK decodes first either way (below), so what is
    #     kept versus dropped agrees — only the kept bytes differ.
    #
    # And one refusal that remains, narrowed to where it is honest: an
    # allow-list that names a RAWTEXT container (`script`, `style`,
    # `title`, `textarea`, `xmp`, `iframe`, `noembed`, `noframes`,
    # `plaintext`), foreign content (`svg`, `math`), or `template`
    # raises — parsing INSIDE those is a different grammar and serving
    # it wrong is a mutation-XSS vector. No caller in the corpus asks for
    # any of them; Rails itself deletes `mglyph` and `malignmark` from
    # caller lists (namespace confusion), which this port does too,
    # silently, as the gem does.
    #
    # The `style` ATTRIBUTE is the one allowance served by DROPPING it.
    # Its value wants Loofah's CSS scrubber (`scrub_css`, over the Crass
    # tokenizer), which is not ported, and keeping it unscrubbed would be
    # the unsafe direction; so an allowed `style` is removed from every
    # element instead, where the gem keeps the declarations its CSS
    # safe-list passes. The lexxy gem allows it (its engine adds `style`
    # to Action Text's list, for the editor's highlight colours), which is
    # how campfire reaches this: on a lane that runs the gem sanitizer
    # (CRuby) a message's inline styles survive, on this one they do

    # ── auto_link ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

    # Rails' `auto_link` — the `rails_autolink` gem, PORTED as a scanner
    # so every target compiles it. campfire renders EVERY message body
    # through it (`MessagesHelper#message_presentation` is
    # `auto_link h(...), html: { target: "_blank" }`), so unlike
    # `sanitize` this is on the read path and a refusing stub is not an
    # option.
    #
    # The gem is TWO REGEXES AND A RULE TABLE, and the rule table is the
    # part that matters: which schemes count, which characters end a
    # URL, which trailing punctuation is the sentence's rather than the
    # link's, what an e-mail local part may contain. Ported, not derived
    # — deriving one of these from taste is how you link half a URL.
    # The gem's own source, for the record:
    #
    #   AUTO_LINK_RE = %r{
    #     (?: ((?:ed2k|ftp|http|https|irc|mailto|news|gopher|nntp|telnet|
    #            webcal|xmpp|callto|feed|svn|urn|aim|rsync|tag|ssh|sftp|
    #            rtsp|afs|file):)// | www\.\w )
    #     [^\s< "]+
    #   }ix
    #   AUTO_EMAIL_LOCAL_RE = /[\w.!#\$%&'*\/=?^`{|}~+-]/
    #   AUTO_EMAIL_RE = /(?<!#{LOCAL})[\w.!#\$%+-]\.?#{LOCAL}*@
    #                    [\w-]+(?:\.[\w-]+)+/
    #
    # WHY A SCANNER AND NOT THOSE REGEXES. Two reasons, and only the
    # second is spinel's:
    #
    #   * `\p{Word}` in the trailing-punctuation strip and the lookbehind
    #     in the e-mail pattern are not a portable regex subset;
    #     matz/spinel#4143 rejects `\p{...}` at compile time outright.
    #   * The gem drives them with `gsub` + `$&` / `$'` / `` $` `` and
    #     decides from the text on either side of the match whether it is
    #     already inside a tag or inside an `<a>`. A left-to-right scan
    #     that carries that state is the same answer without the globals,
    #     which no strict target models.
    #
    # Rails' `auto_link` safe-list-sanitizes the whole body first
    # (`conditional_sanitize`, on by default), and so does this — through
    # `sanitize` above, the same engine the message filters run. That
    # pass is where an element the default list does not allow is
    # stripped with its children kept: an `<action-text-attachment>`
    # whose partial `Content#render_attachments` has just rendered
    # inside it arrives on the page as the partial alone, which is what
    # Rails serves. This file used to skip the pass, when the shared
    # `sanitize` was a raising façade rather than an engine; the
    # divergence that skip cost is closed and the probes in
    # `tests/shared_autolink.rb` that pinned it now pin the gem's
    # default answers instead.
    #
    # `sanitize: false` skips the pass, as it does in the gem. What the
    # gem's flag also does — forward itself as `content_tag`'s `escape` —
    # never bites: `escape` is true only when the sanitize ran, and a
    # sanitized value is an html_safe buffer, which `content_tag`
    # splices raw regardless. So the anchors this helper CREATES are
    # the same under either setting, and they are safe by the rule
    # table above either way: the scheme list has no `javascript:` in
    # it and the `www.` branch is prefixed `http://`.
    #
    # NOT MODELLED: the block form (`auto_link(text) { |url| ... }`,
    # which rewrites the link TEXT). No corpus call site passes one, and
    # a block argument through the strict targets is a shape this file
    # has no other use for.
    #
    # `sanitize_options: { tags:, attributes: }` replaces the pass's
    # lists, each falling back to the default when absent — the gem hands
    # them to the same sanitizer. campfire passes both (the Lexxy merge:
    # `MessagesHelper::AUTO_LINK_ALLOWED_TAGS`, the defaults plus the
    # editor's `s`, `u`, `mark`, table markup and `data-language`); with
