# Surface tracks what real-blog actually uses (cf. fixtures/real-blog/
# app/views/**/*.html.erb): link_to, button_to, dom_id, the content_for
# slot store, turbo_stream_from, truncate, pluralize (delegated to
# Inflector), plus four form_with macro-inline primitives
# (csrf_token_hidden_input, method_override_input, optional_value_attr,
# escape_or_empty). form_with itself + the FormBuilder class are
# retired: the lowerer macro-expands `<%= form_with ... do |form| ... %>`
# and `form.label`/`form.text_field`/`form.text_area`/`form.submit`
# at lower time into direct HTML accumulation, so no runtime
# FormBuilder dispatch survives in lowered output.
#
# Polymorphic dispatch (e.g., link_to "Edit", @article → article_path)
# is the lowerer's job, not the runtime's. Call sites pass explicit
# paths — `link_to "Edit", RouteHelpers.article_path(article.id)`.
# This keeps the runtime small and free of class-name-keyed dispatch.

    # when it captures into a heap poly proc (matz/spinel#4245), and a
    # `^() -> String` proc ARGUMENT needs a `.call` + function-type arm
    # in every one of the nine target emitters this file must lower
    # through — a wide toll for one flag toggle.
    #
    # NO `ensure`, also deliberately. A raise inside the render leaves
    # the flag set for the REMAINDER of that one request only;
    # `reset_slots!` — every lane's per-request dispatch entry — clears
    # it, so nothing leaks into later requests. (Statement-position
    # begin/ensure is likewise a construct half the targets have no

    # They are not interchangeable, and the difference is exactly the
    # thing `csrf_token_hidden_input` branches on two methods up: a
    # broadcast render omits the authenticity_token input because its
    # output is for OTHER sessions' pages. Cache them together and the
    # first render of a message decides for all of them — a request
    # warms the entry and every subscriber gets the warming session's
    # token, or a broadcast warms it and the page that posted the
    # message renders a form without one. Rails has this hazard and
    # lives with it (its cached fragment encodes render history, which
    # is the one divergence scripts/campfire-compare forgives by name);
    # separating the namespaces costs one prefix and removes it.
    #
    # A prefix rather than a flag consulted inside `Rails::Cache`,
    # because this is a VIEW-layer distinction and the store should not
    # have to know about it — and because a namespace lets broadcasts
    # keep a cache of their own instead of forgoing one.

    # This is the FALLBACK that keeps the macro-inline total. The view
    # walker expands `form_with` at lower time and that is still the
    # path every template takes; what it cannot reach is a `form_with`
    # written inside an `app/helpers/` MODULE, where the options are a
    # runtime value (campfire's `FormsHelper#auto_submit_form_with`
    # forwards `attributes.merge(data: data)`) and there is no
    # accumulator to splice statements into. Unqualified, that call was
    # a bare name nothing in the tree defines: spinel dropped the
    # helper's whole body and the LINKER failed on the caller's
    # reference to it — `undefined symbol
    # _sp_FormsHelper_s_auto_submit_form_with`. Same hole, and same
    # answer, as `polymorphic_url` and `content_tag` beside it.
    #
    # NO BLOCK FORM. `form_with … do |form|` yields a FormBuilder bound
    # to a model, which is exactly the thing the macro-inline exists to
    # resolve statically; a runtime FormBuilder would need the model's
    # column types at run time. A helper that forwards a block gets the
    # blockless form's markup and the block is not called — recorded in
    # docs/pipeline/runtime.md rather than silently approximated.
    #
    # ATTRIBUTE ORDER IS RAILS': the caller's own options first, then
    # `action`, `accept-charset`, `method` — which is what
    # `html_options_for_form_with` builds and what the compare oracle
    # would read. `action` is OMITTED when no `url:` is given; Rails
    # puts the current request path there, and a form with no action
    # posts to the current URL, so the behaviour matches and the bytes
    # do not (the divergence is in docs/pipeline/runtime.md).
