# Raw-SQL surface of `Model.connection` / `ActiveRecord::Base.connection`.
#
# Rails hands back the adapter itself here; this runtime hands back a
# thin stateless facade over the per-target `Db` primitive shim — just
# the members the corpus reaches for when it drops below the Relation
# layer (lobsters' Keystore upserts, hand-written aggregate queries,
# `quote`/`quote_string` in SQL-building helpers). Statically
# resolvable by construction: fixed methods, no method_missing.
#
# Result rows are `Hash[String, untyped]` — raw SQL is the one place
# the row shape is genuinely dynamic (aliased aggregates, computed
# columns), so a typed bag is the honest contract rather than an
# avoidable erasure.

    # its FTS index this way). The head is the fragment and the tail
    # are its binds, escaped left to right, which is exactly what
    # `Relation`'s `where("… ?", x)` already does — same rule, reached
    # from the class instead of from a relation.
    #
    # HERE and not in `base.rb`: this file is the raw-SQL tier the
    # strict targets do not stage, and `sanitize_sql` belongs to it

    # .escape_value`, which is on the RBS adapter contract but NOT on
    # the narrower hand-written Go/Rust adapter interfaces, and its one

    # The BIND COUNT is authoritative, not the placeholder count: Ruby
    # drops a trailing empty field, so `"… where rowid = ?"` splits to
    # one part, and appending a bind after each part while binds remain
    # reconstructs it exactly. A `?` with no bind left is dropped, which
