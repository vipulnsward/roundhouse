    # `cols.map { |c| record.saved_change_to_attribute(c) }`). The
    # per-column `saved_change_to_<col>?` / `<col>_previously_changed?`
    # spellings are synthesized by the lowering instead, since a static
    # runtime cannot answer a name it only learns at emit time.
    #
    # Defined against `saved_changes` rather than the tracking ivar, so
    # they inherit whichever implementation the target has: the real
    # snapshot diff on the ruby-family trees (the connection.rb reopen)
    # and the empty-Hash subset on the strict lanes, where every Dirty
    # predicate already answers false by design.
    # Two shapes here are load-bearing, both learned from strict lanes
    # going red — neither is style, and neither is visible to
    # `compare ruby` or the unit tests:
    #
    # (1) `key?`, not `!saved_changes[name].nil?`. rust2 lowers an
    #     untyped map read to the total
    #     `.get().cloned().unwrap_or(Value::Null)`, and `.nil?` on that
    #     renders as `is_none()` — an Option method
    #     `serde_json::Value` does not have (E0599). The per-column
    #     synthesis CAN use the nil-test, because it runs against the
    #     model's own typed slot table rather than a json bag.
    #     Presence and non-nil are the same question here anyway:
    #     `__track_saved_changes` inserts a key only when the value
    #     actually changed, and always as a [prev, value] pair.
    #
    # (2) Bind the collection to a local before calling a collection
    #     method on it. elixir2's receiver typing does not see through
    #     a method-call receiver, so `saved_changes.key?(name)` lowers
    #     the `key?` as a struct-field access
    #     (`saved_changes(record).__struct__`) and fails the
    #     warnings-as-errors gate. `has_attribute?` above and

    # instead of the readers indexing the diff themselves: the pair is
    # `[prev, value]` in a heterogeneous Hash, and indexing it renders

    # real; here the empty diff makes this nil, which is the honest
    # strict answer and matches every Dirty predicate answering false.

    # `Map`/`Set` use `===` reference equality, Rust uses `Eq`/`Hash`
    # derives, etc. Per-target runtimes that need value equality
    # implement it on the appropriate target shape (e.g.
    # `juntos.ts`'s ApplicationRecord exposes `equals(other)` if
    # callers need it). Adding the methods to base.rb produced
    # broken emit (`[Klass, @id].hash` has no JS equivalent) without
    # any caller benefit.
