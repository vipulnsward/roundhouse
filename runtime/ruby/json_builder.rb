# JSON encoding primitives used by Views::*.<x>_json render methods —
# the lowered output of `*.json.jbuilder` templates. Hand-rolled to drop
# the stdlib `json` dependency (which spinel doesn't ship), and to keep
# the surface small enough that the same Ruby transpiles cleanly to
# every Group 1 target.
#
# Scope: three primitives the Jbuilder lowerer needs for real-blog
# templates — encode_string (RFC 8259 escaping for the common cases),
# encode_value (type-dispatched scalar encoder), and encode_datetime
# (Rails-compatible ISO 8601 reformat for `datetime` columns). The
# lowerer inlines `{`/`,`/`}` and `[`/`,`/`]` directly into method
# bodies, so the runtime has no array_join / object_pairs primitive
# today; those land when stretch DSL forms (json.merge!, dynamic-shape
# objects) need them.
#
# Decimal handling is still the lowerer's job: call sites pass strings
# or pre-formatted values. encode_datetime is bundled here because the
# input is uniformly a sqlite-shape TEXT timestamp and the output
# format is Rails-canonical; doing the reformat in the runtime keeps
# the lowerer's column-aware routing simple (just "is this column a
# datetime, yes or no").
