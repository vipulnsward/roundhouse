    # timestamp and answer 304 on a match. Neither half of that
    # comparison exists here: this controller has no request object
    # (only `@request_format`), so there is nothing to read the
    # conditional headers FROM, and the extra-header hash above is
    # buffered but never sent, so there is nothing to write the
    # validators TO.
    #
    # What IS available is the answer Rails gives when a client sends
    # no conditional header at all: the response is stale, render it.
    # That is this implementation, and it is a subset rather than a
    # stub — always-render is semantically CORRECT for every request,
    # it just never earns the 304. The cost is bandwidth, not
    # behavior, which is why it can ship ahead of the plumbing.
    #
    # Monomorphic on the shapes the corpus writes — `fresh_when
    # @messages` and `stale?(etag: record)`. Rails accepts several more
    # (`fresh_when(etag:, last_modified:)`, `stale?(record)`); each
    # would be its own method here when a call site asks, rather than
    # one method with a union parameter no target can narrow.
    # Empty body, not `nil`: the same no-op idiom
    # `Base.preload_associations` uses. A body that is only a bare `nil`
    # gives Rust an `Option` with nothing to infer its parameter from
    # (`E0282: type annotations needed` on a lone `None;`), where an
    # empty body is a plain `void`.
    # The parameter is NOT named `record`: the Elixir emitter prepends
    # the controller struct as an implicit first argument and calls it
    # `record`, so a same-named parameter of our own emits
    # `def fresh_when(_record, _record)` — a duplicate match variable,
