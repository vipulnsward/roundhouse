    # comparison exists here: this controller has no request object
    # (only `@request_format`), so there is nothing to read the
    # conditional headers FROM, and the extra-header hash above is
    # buffered but never sent, so there is nothing to write the
    # validators TO.
    #
    # What IS available is the answer Rails gives when a client sends
    # no conditional header at all: the response is stale, render it.
    # That is this implementation, and it is a subset rather than a
    # stub — always-render is semantically CORRECT for every request,
    # it just never earns the 304. The cost is bandwidth, not
    # behavior, which is why it can ship ahead of the plumbing.

    # Monomorphic on the shapes the corpus writes — `fresh_when
    # @messages` and `stale?(etag: record)`. Rails accepts several more
    # (`fresh_when(etag:, last_modified:)`, `stale?(record)`); each
    # would be its own method here when a call site asks, rather than
    # one method with a union parameter no target can narrow.
    # Empty body, not `nil`: the same no-op idiom
    # `Base.preload_associations` uses. A body that is only a bare `nil`
    # gives Rust an `Option` with nothing to infer its parameter from
    # (`E0282: type annotations needed` on a lone `None;`), where an
    # empty body is a plain `void`.
    # The parameter is NOT named `record`: the Elixir emitter prepends
    # the controller struct as an implicit first argument and calls it
    # `record`, so a same-named parameter of our own emits
    # `def fresh_when(_record, _record)` — a duplicate match variable,
    # which that target's `--warnings-as-errors` build rejects. Every
    # other method here already avoids the name; this one found out why.

    # `expires_in 1.year, public: true` — Rails' Cache-Control writer.
    # campfire's QR code, avatar and logo actions all open with one, and
    # the QR test reads the result back
    # (`response.cache_control[:max_age]`), which is what makes this a
    # VALUE the harness carries rather than a header it would be enough
    # to buffer.
    #
    # SECONDS, not a Duration. `lower::duration`'s `rewrite_expires_in`
    # unwraps the corpus' `1.year` at the CALL SITE — the same grounding
    # `signed_id(expires_in:)` gets — so this signature stays Integer
    # and no strict target pays for an `untyped` parameter here.
    # `stale_while_revalidate: 0` means "not stated", which keeps the
    # parameter Integer rather than nullable; two of campfire's three
    # call sites pass it, so accepting only `public:` would have turned
    # a NoMethodError into an ArgumentError at those two and looked like
    # progress.

    # NO HEADER IS WRITTEN. Composing the `Cache-Control` string here
    # and parking it in the buffered-but-unsent `headers` hash above

    # survive the Rust emitter, which renders a Hash index-assign as
    # `self.headers[k] = v` where `HashMap` wants `.insert()` (E0594:
