# Controller-level cookie access — Rails' `cookies` CookieJar. `cookies[:k]`
# reads the inbound cookie; `cookies[:k] = v` (and `cookies.permanent[:k] = v`)
# records a write the dispatcher serializes as Set-Cookie.
#
# Ruby-family only, like current.rb beside this file: a CookieJar-typed field
# on Base must NOT transpile to the strict targets (they don't exercise
# cookies), so it lives in a reopen outside the strict-target tables rather
# than in the universal base.rb. Required by the action_controller.rb
# aggregator, which the ruby/jruby/spinel trees follow (the strict targets
# emit their runtime from tables and never see it).
#
# Keys normalize to String — exactly as ActionDispatch::Session does — so
# both CRuby's symbolized inbound cookies and spinel's string-keyed
# `Tep.str_hash` route through one store. This replaces the former CRuby-only
# overlay CookieJar; one typed implementation now serves all three ruby-family
# targets.
