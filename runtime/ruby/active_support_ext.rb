# ActiveSupport blank-predicate reopen — ruby-family surface only
# (inflector_ext.rb pattern): shipped to the scaffold trees via the
# project.rs stems list, NOT in the runtime_loader tables, so the
# strict-target transpilers never see the `is_a?` dispatch below.
#
# `src/lower/blank.rs` grounds `blank?`/`present?`/`presence` by the
# receiver's static type and every target compiles the result. What it
# CANNOT ground is a receiver it has no type for — an untyped reader, an
# unresolved inference var, a multi-variant union. Those kept their
# dynamic `x.present?` call, which only CRuby could serve (the core_ext
# reopen of Object); on an AOT tree the send had nowhere to land, and
# lobsters' `Pushover.API_TOKEN.present?` — an unassigned `cattr_accessor`
# read, i.e. nil — took every /settings render down with it.
#
# So the residue routes HERE instead. Taking the receiver as an ARGUMENT
# is what makes this legal where the type-directed forms are not: the
# value is evaluated exactly once, so a receiver with effects grounds
# too, and no `respond_to?` is needed because the branch is on the value.
#
# Semantics are Rails', not an approximation — nil, false, and an empty
# String/Array/Hash are blank; `0` and `:sym` are present. Verified shape
# by shape against `Object#blank?`.
#
# The STRING tail is `strip.empty?`, not `empty?`: ActiveSupport's
# `String#blank?` is `/\A[[:space:]]*\z/`, so `" ".blank?` is true.
# `lower::blank` grounds the typed String sites the same way and for the
# same reason — the two must agree, because which of them serves a given
# call is a fact about type INFERENCE, not about the program. campfire's
# bot API is what priced it: `raw_request_body.blank?` reaches this
# function (the reader's type is not inferred), and a boost posted with
# a body of three spaces was accepted where Rails answers 422.
#
# `to_s` first, so the tail is one branch for every remaining shape: an
# Integer's `"0"` is not blank, a Symbol's `"sym"` is not blank, and a
# String is itself.
