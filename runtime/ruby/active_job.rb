# ActiveJob under the transpiled runtime: the adapter is `:inline` —
# there is no queue daemon in-process, so the class-side entries
# (`perform_later`, `set(...).perform_later`) are synthesized by
# `lower::job_class_side` to run `new.perform(...)` synchronously.
# Under test it is `:test` instead, which enqueues without running;
# see `ENQUEUE_ONLY` below for why that difference is load-bearing.
# This base class exists so `class ApplicationJob < ActiveJob::Base`
# resolves and the class-body DSL is inert.

module ActiveJob
  # Jobs that have RUN, by class name, in call order.
  #
  # The adapter is inline, so there is no queue to inspect — which is
  # also true of Rails' own `:inline` adapter, and why Rails' test
  # helpers require the `:test` one. This log is the equivalent seam:
  # `perform_later` appends here before dispatching, so
  # "jobs enqueued during this block" and "jobs run during this block"
  # are the same set. The divergence is a job enqueued and never run,
  # which inline semantics cannot produce.
  #
  # Same shape as `Broadcasts::LOG` and for the same reasons — a
  # module-level constant Array rather than a class ivar, because that
  # is the form every target carries. Entries are class NAMES, not
  # classes: a class is not a first-class value on the strict targets,
  # and the test call sites that name one are rewritten to the string
  # at compile time (`lower::job_test_only`).

  # No reset: every helper reads a LENGTH DELTA across its block, the
  # same way `capture_turbo_stream_broadcasts` reads `Broadcasts::LOG`,

  # clear would hide what an earlier block in the same test did.

  # ---- The `:test` adapter -------------------------------------------
  #
  # Rails' test environment does NOT use the inline adapter: it uses
  # `:test`, which ENQUEUES and does not run. That distinction is
  # load-bearing, not cosmetic. campfire's `Message` has
  # `after_create_commit -> { room.receive(self) }`, whose tail is
  # `Room::PushMessageJob.perform_later` — under inline dispatch EVERY
  # message a fixture loads would run `Room::MessagePusher`, and the
  # whole suite dies in its unresolvable nested join. Rails' own suite
  # never reaches that code because its adapter enqueues.
  #
  # A SUSPENSION STACK, not a boolean: `perform_enqueued_jobs { … }`
  # nests, and a depth counter is what makes an inner block restore the
  # outer state rather than clobber it. Spelled as a module-level
  # constant Array read through `length` — the same form `PERFORMED`
  # and `Broadcasts::LOG` take, and for the same reason: an Array
  # constant is the only mutable module state every target carries (a
  # `[0] =` index assignment is a shape several emitters do not).
  #
  # Empty is the default, so nothing changes for an app: `main.rb`
  # never touches this and its jobs still run at the call site. The
  # emitted test harness pushes once at boot.
  ENQUEUE_ONLY = []

  # Named without a `?`: predicate mangling for a MODULE function is
  # not uniform across targets (rust2 makes `<name>_pred`, the TS
  # Module mode emits a bare `?` and fails to parse). The same reason
  # `Params.provided` carries the name it does.
  def self.enqueue_only
    ENQUEUE_ONLY.length > 0

  # without dispatching.
  def self.enqueue_without_running

  # Back to inline dispatch. `perform_enqueued_jobs { … }` brackets its
  # block with this and `enqueue_without_running`, which is the honest
  # reading of Rails' "drain the queue now": we hold no arguments to
  # replay, so the jobs the block enqueues run as it enqueues them.
  def self.run_enqueued
    ENQUEUE_ONLY.pop
    nil
  end

  # ---- A real queue -------------------------------------------------
  #
  # `perform_later` PUTS THE WORK DOWN AND RETURNS, which is what Rails
  # means by it. Everything above this describes the two postures that
  # came before: run at the call site, or skip. Neither is what Rails
  # does, and the difference showed up the moment a real app was driven
  # rather than tested — campfire's `Message` has `after_create_commit
  # -> { room.receive(self) }` whose tail is a `perform_later`, so
  # posting a message ran web-push delivery INSIDE the POST. On the
  # spinel binary, where an unhandled error ends the process rather
  # than the request, that is a 500 at best.
  #
  # A ZERO-ARGUMENT PROC IS THE ENTRY, and that is what makes this
  # expressible on a strict target at all. A queue of jobs is
  # heterogeneous by nature — `Room::PushMessageJob` takes (room,
  # message), another takes an Integer — and there is nowhere to put
  # that on a target with one element type per container. A Proc
  # closing over its own arguments erases the difference: every entry
  # is `() -> nil`, whatever it closed over. Probed on spinel before
  # this was written, with two job classes of different arities and
  # argument types, and the output is byte-identical to CRuby's.
  #
  # ONE QUEUE, NOT ONE PER QUEUE NAME. `queue_as` is inert here (see
  # `Base` below) because a single in-process drain has no scheduling
  # decision to make: there is no worker pool to allocate and no
  # priority to honour, so recording the name would suggest an ordering
  # guarantee nothing implements.
  PENDING = []

  # Whether a drain exists to pick the work up. Empty means no — and
  # then `perform_later` runs inline, exactly as before, because a job
  # put on a queue nobody drains is a job silently dropped, which is
  # the failure mode this whole file is trying not to have.
  #
  # `main.rb` opts in by spawning the drain; the emitted test harness
  # does not, so the suite keeps the inline semantics its assertions
  # were written against.

  # sub-expression.
  #
  # It is declared `untyped` rather than `^() -> nil` only because the
  # RBS reader does not support ProcType yet ("unsupported RBS type

  # — Rails logs the same event — and the queue moves on.
