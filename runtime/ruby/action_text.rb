# Action Text's value layer: the HTML fragment a `has_rich_text`
# attribute holds, and the attachment nodes embedded in it.
#
# `ActionText::RichText` is NOT here — it is a table-backed model
# (`action_text_rich_texts`), so roundhouse synthesizes it through the
# ordinary model lowering (`src/lower/rich_text.rs`) and every target
# gets columns, `where`, hydration and persistence for free. What that
# model cannot get from the schema is the `serialize :body, coder:
# ActionText::Content` half — the column stores HTML text, the
# attribute reads back as this object. So this file is exactly the
# coder, and nothing else.
#
# WHY A HAND-ROLLED SCANNER. Rails builds a Nokogiri document and walks
# it bottom-up (`ActionText::PlainTextConversion`). There is no
# Nokogiri here and no regex engine in the framework runtime, so
# `to_plain_text` is a single left-to-right pass with a small tag
# stack. The rules below are transcribed from
# actiontext/lib/action_text/plain_text_conversion.rb rather than
# derived — same reason the inflector ports Rails' tables instead of
# guessing them.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY MISSING: `attachables`. An attachment node
# carries a SIGNED GlobalID (`sgid`), and turning that back into a
# record needs SignedGlobalID verification plus a GlobalID URI parse
# plus a registry lookup — a body of work of its own, and none of it
# is expressible over the attributes this scanner already has.
# `attachments` therefore returns the PARSED nodes (complete: every
# attribute the markup carried), and `attachables` returns `[]` with
# the divergence stated at its definition and ledgered in
# docs/pipeline/runtime.md.
# Attachments wrap Active Storage blobs (a filename is an
# `ActiveStorage::Filename`), as in Rails.

module ActionText
  # The marker a model mixes in to say "I can be attached to rich text"
  # (campfire's `User::Mentionable` is one). EMPTY, and that is the
  # whole of it here: in Rails the module also supplies the sgid round
  # trip (`attachable_sgid`, `from_node`) and partial-path defaults,
  # and an app that includes it overrides the partial paths itself —
  # which is the half that is actually reached, since nothing here
  # dereferences an sgid (see `Content#attachables`). Declared so the
  # `include` resolves at load time rather than taking the app down
  # before it serves a request.
  module Attachable
    # `locate(model_name, id)` — the record an sgid names, or nil. THIS
    # body is the default, and it is REDEFINED per app: the models that
    # mix this module in are a compile-time set, so
    # `project::apply_attachable_locate` generates the real method into
    # the emitted tree's `global_id_locator.rb` (the ruby family's
    # locator file, required after this one by both boots) as a `case`
    # over them — `when "User" then User.find_by(id: id)`. The switch IS
    # the registry: no `const_get`, nothing filled in at load time. An
    # app with no attachable model keeps this nil, so every sgid reads
    # as missing there, which is what Rails answers for a gid naming no
    # class. Redefinition by a later reopen is a shape both CRuby and

# `ActionText::ContentHelper` — the sanitizer Action Text runs rich text
# through, and the allow-lists it runs it with.
#
# WHY IT IS HERE AT ALL. campfire's presentation filter chain ends in
# `ContentFilters::SanitizeAttributes`, which asks for
# `ActionText::ContentHelper.sanitizer.class`, `.new`s it, and calls
# `.sanitize(html, tags:, attributes:)`. Without this the chain raised
# `uninitialized constant ActionText::ContentHelper` — and campfire wraps
# the whole chain in its own `rescue Exception` returning `""`, so every
# message body rendered EMPTY behind a 200. It was the second wall behind
# the class-side `new` one, found the same way.
#
# actiontext 8.0.5, `app/helpers/action_text/content_helper.rb`:
#
#   mattr_accessor(:sanitizer, default: Rails::HTML4::Sanitizer.safe_list_sanitizer.new)
#   mattr_accessor(:allowed_attributes)
#
# so `allowed_attributes` is nil until an app sets it, and the caller
# falls back to `sanitizer_class.allowed_attributes + Attachment::
# ATTRIBUTES`. Both halves are reproduced rather than guessed.
module ActionText
  # The `value` Lexxy's editor tag carries, from the rich text's stored
  # HTML: lexxy 0.9's `render_custom_attachments_in`, which the gem runs
  # on every editor it renders (`lexxy/rich_text_area_tag.rb`). Each
  # `<action-text-attachment>` without a `url` gets its rendered partial
  # in `content`, as JSON, and keeps (or gets) its `content-type` — the
  # editor rebuilds mentions and embeds from those two attributes. nil
  # when the body is blank, which omits the attribute, as Rails does
  # for a new message.
  #
  # `content` is JSON-encoded by `JsonBuilder`, which escapes `<`, `>`
  # and `&` as ActiveSupport's encoder does (the JSON text is its, byte
  # for byte, for a String).
  #
  # Written against `css`'s BOUND nodes rather than `replace`'s block:
  # each write splices the fragment at its node's offset, so the nodes
  # are visited last-first and every earlier offset stays true.

    # the attachment attributes, which is what `sanitizer_allowed_
    # attributes` computes in `actiontext/app/helpers/action_text/
    # content_helper.rb` and what campfire's `SanitizeAttributes` copies
    # verbatim as its `||` fallback.
    #
    # A DELIBERATE DIVERGENCE, ledgered in docs/pipeline/runtime.md:
    # Rails' `mattr_accessor(:allowed_attributes)` has no default, so
    # this reader answers nil in an app that never configured it, and
    # every caller reaches its own `||` fallback. We answer the list
    # that fallback computes.
    #
    # Why: the fallback goes through `sanitizer.class`, and a method
    # call on a CLASS OBJECT is dynamic for us and for spinel alike —
    # `Array[untyped]`, handed to a `sanitize` that takes
    # `Array[String]` twelve lines down. Answering nil made the two
    # descriptions of one list contradict, and the campfire binary
    # failed to LINK on it. The VALUES are identical either way, so no
    # app that uses the list can tell; only one that asks whether it is
    # nil can, and none does.
    #
    # Plus what the APP adds at boot, which Rails keeps in the same
    # `mattr_accessor`: campfire's `lib/rails_ext/action_text_allowed_tags.rb`
    # unions in `ContentFilters::EDITOR_FORMATTING_ATTRIBUTES`, and the
    # lexxy gem's engine adds its own (`data-language`, `style`, …). Both
    # are read at compile time (`ingest::app::content_helper_attribute_
    # additions`) into the generated list below — the value, not a
    # replay of the initializer.
