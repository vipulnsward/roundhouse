# Active Storage — what a `has_one_attached` reader hands back, the
# blob it points at, and the identity "variant" of that blob.
#
# Sits beside `ActionText::Content` and for the same reason: the
# proxy has no table, so it is framework Ruby rather than a
# synthesized model. The ROWS (`active_storage_attachments`,
# `active_storage_blobs`) are read and written here with raw SQL
# through the adapter, the way `Relation` itself composes.
#
# # Three halves, and where each lives
#
# Active Storage is three things: attachment ROWS (which record, which
# blob, under which name), BLOBS (bytes in a service), and VARIANTS
# (derivatives produced by an image processor).
#
# * ROWS are fully modeled here, in the shared runtime: `attached?`,
#   `filename`, `content_type`, `attach`, `purge`, and the preload the
#   batch loader drives.
# * BLOB BYTES go through `ActiveStorage::Service`, whose methods here
#   RAISE: the shared runtime does no file I/O anywhere (grep it), so
#   a storage service is a per-target seam. The ruby family reopens the
#   class with a disk service (`runtime/spinel/active_storage_disk.rb`)
#   under Rails' own `storage/files/<xx>/<yy>/<key>` layout. `Blob
#   .create_and_upload!` and `Attached#attach` write the ROW here and
#   hand the bytes to the service, so a target that has one gets the
#   whole feature and a target that has none fails at the one named
#   seam.
# * VARIANTS are Rails' `VariantWithRecord`: the ROWS
#   (`active_storage_variant_records` + the record's `image`
#   attachment) are modeled here, the PIXELS are a per-target seam.
#   `has_one_attached :logo do |attachable| attachable.variant :large,
#   resize_to_limit: [512, 512], format: :png end` is lowered into the
#   proxy's constructor as `Variation` values; `variant(:large)`
#   answers a `VariantWithRecord` over the blob and that variation, and
#   `.processed` finds the variant record or makes one — downloading
#   the original, handing it to `Processor.transform`, uploading the
#   result as a blob of its own. `Processor` RAISES in the shared
#   runtime (it decodes and encodes images); the ruby family reopens it
#   over ruby-vips (`runtime/spinel/active_storage_processor.rb`), and
#   a tree without that reopen fails at the one named seam rather than
#   serving the original as its own thumbnail. `variable?` is Rails'
#   content-type question (can a variant be MADE from this), answered
#   from `variable_content_types`, so an image goes down the image
#   path and a PDF down the link path exactly as in Rails.
#   `preview` (a poster frame for a video, a page for a PDF) has no
#   previewer — there is no still to serve — so it raises, and
#   `previewable?` is false so no view reaches it.
#
# # The reader never returns nil
#
# Rails' `record.logo` is an `Attached::One` proxy whether or not
# anything is attached, which is why app code writes `logo.attached?`
# and `logo.variable?` without a nil guard. The reader keeps that
# contract by always constructing one of these.

  # bmp/ico/psd, whose loaders it does not trust) has the trim lifted

# Active Storage's ROUTE helpers, reopened onto the app's generated

#
# They live here rather than in `lower::routes_to_library` because they
# are not the app's routes: Rails mounts them from the Active Storage
# engine, so `config/routes.rb` never names them and the generator that
# reads it cannot know they exist. The routes themselves are served by
# the ruby family's `ActiveStorage::Routes` (the engine's three
# controllers), which is why the URL shapes here are Rails' own:
#
#   /rails/active_storage/blobs/redirect/:signed_id/*filename
#   /rails/active_storage/representations/redirect/:signed_blob_id/:variation_key/*filename
#   /rails/active_storage/disk/:encoded_key/*filename
#   /rails/active_storage/direct_uploads              (POST)
#   /rails/active_storage/disk/:encoded_token         (PUT)
#
# `disposition` and `only_path` are spelled out because those are the
# two options an ingested app has written. `_url` is the same string as
# `_path`: the app's own `_url` helpers are lowered host-less too.
