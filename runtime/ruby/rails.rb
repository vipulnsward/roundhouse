  # `Rails.cache`, in two halves.
  #
  # `fetch` stays the recompute-every-call no-op it has always been. Its
  # value is whatever the block returns — an Integer count, a Relation, a
  # rendered fragment — and one store holding all of those needs the
  # heterogeneous box this runtime deliberately doesn't have.
  #
  # `fetch_str` is the typed half: String keys, String values, expiry at
  # second granularity. `src/lower/rails_cache.rs` routes the fetch sites
  # whose block provably yields a String — the rendered fragments — here,
  # and those are where the cost is. Lobsters caches its users tree for
  # 24h; recomputing that ~292KB fragment on every request is 15 of the
  # 114 visits in the benchmark sequence and most of the spinel lane's
  # iteration time.
  #
  # Process-local and UNSYNCHRONIZED, which is a two-layer decision.
  # `Mutex` is not a construct this file can spell: runtime/ruby is
  # transpiled to nine targets and a lock would need an arm in each. On
  # the single-threaded lanes there is nothing to guard, and on rust and
  # go the emitter already puts a class-level slot behind its own lock
  # per access. The lane that has real parallelism is the spinel binary
  # (a green thread per connection), and that is where the synchronized
  # store lives — runtime/spinel reopens this class, the same override
  # seam csrf_token.rb uses. A read-then-write pair is not atomic even
  # there, and for a cache that is benign: two threads both render, one
  # write wins.

  # the emitted rescue and rebuilding. A binary whose only failure
  # report is a swallowed one is harder to diagnose than Rails, not
  # easier; the request path still doesn't DEPEND on log output, but
