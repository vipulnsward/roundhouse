# scripts/campfire-oracle-seed.rb — the benchmark dataset, seeded through
# Rails so the emit can be handed the SAME sqlite file.
#
# Run by `scripts/campfire-oracle prepare` via `bin/rails runner`; kept as
# its own file rather than a heredoc so it is diffable and so the emit lane
# can point at the identical rows.
#
# Shaped after campfire's own config/environments/performance.rb (users,
# sessions with `"a"*19 + id`, rooms, memberships) but SMALLER and
# parameterised: their 10k users / 201 rooms is a socket fan-out fixture,
# and a request-throughput lane wants pages that render in a comparable
# time, not the largest DB it can build.
#
# INSERT_ALL, NOT create!, for the same reason Rails' own seeder does it:
# callbacks here would mint push notifications and broadcasts, and this is
# fixture construction, not traffic.
#
# WHICH MEANS THE RICH TEXT HAS TO BE WRITTEN BY HAND. `has_rich_text
# :body` hangs the body off an `after_save` callback, so an `insert_all`
# message has NO `action_text_rich_texts` row and `message.body.body` is
# nil. That is not a missing nicety — it is the message's CONTENT, and
# for a while this file produced 500 empty ones:
#
#   * campfire's `message_presentation` rescues the resulting
#     `DelegationError` per message, so the reference server raised,
#     Sentry-captured and logged FORTY exceptions per `/rooms/1` — real
#     work charged to Rails that no other lane does;
#   * both lanes rendered message SHELLS, so the benchmark measured
#     everything about a message except the expensive part (Action Text
#     to HTML, the ContentFilters chain, `auto_link`);
#   * and the emitted tree issued 40 rich-text queries per page that
#     returned nothing.
#
# Rails stores the body column verbatim (measured: `m.body = "Hello
# <b>there</b>"` writes exactly that), so the rows go in beside the
# messages.
